<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
THE LAWRENCES AND OTHERS.</h2>

<p class="p2">"I cannot understand why the children do not
return from the beach. They have been gone so
long."</p>

<p>"None too long," sighed Nathalie Lawrence, swinging
lazily to and fro in a hammock which was hung
across one end of the veranda. "What a heaven it
is without them. I declare, Helen," she continued,
addressing her sister in aggrieved tone, "we do
get a lot of those children, somehow or other. For my
part, I cannot see why you let them stay about with
us all the time, when they are a thousand times better
off with Mary," and she gave a vindictive tug at a
rope fastened to the railing, which sent the hammock
back and forth with the utmost rapidity.</p>

<p>"Take care, Nat; you will be out next, and there
will be a hubbub worse than the children would think
of making in their wildest moments."</p>

<p>The young girl who thus spoke laughed a low,
musical laugh, and looked up from her book with a
pair of wide-open blue eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>"Nathalie, as usual, thinks only of herself," said
Helen with a frown, as she walked away.</p>

<p>"I never can say one word about those children
without raising Helen's ire. She spoils them, and she
might as well admit it."</p>

<p>"In my short and uneventful career," responded
Jean smiling, "I have not found that people are over-fond
of admitting anything, least of all their weaknesses.
I don't see how you can expect Helen to be
superior to all the rest of the world&mdash;yourself and
myself included. Now, imagine," she continued
tantalizingly, "if anyone insisted upon your admitting
your weakness for Mr. Church&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, keep quiet, Jean; you are too stupid."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," cried Jean, jumping up and closing
her book, "of course I am, and that is my weakness;
so now we are quits."</p>

<p>Nathalie tossed her head as much as her position
would permit.</p>

<p>"Jean Lawrence," she said solemnly, "you bore
me."</p>

<p>"What a catastrophe!" Jean flung back her head
with a merry laugh. "Good-by, dear; you are the
picture of injured innocence."</p>

<p>"Jean, come back," cried Nathalie, struggling to
obtain an upright position. "I do think you are too
bad. Ah, well, some day,"&mdash;then breaking into song:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Some day, some day, some day I shall meet you,</p>
<p class="i2">Love, I know not when nor how;</p>
<p>Love, I know not when nor how. Only this,</p>
<p class="i2">Only this, only this, that once you loved me;</p>
<p>Only this, I love you now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
"Rats!" called out a small voice from the lawn
below.</p>

<p>Nathalie raised herself on her elbow, and peered
through the railing.</p>

<p>"Larry, I am thunderstruck. What is the meaning
of that weird expression?"</p>

<p>"Nathalie singing a love song," cried Larry, scampering
about on the lawn. "Oh, what fun!"</p>

<p>"Larry," called Helen, coming out once more on
to the veranda. "Where are Willie and Gladys?
Why did you stay so long? I have been worrying
about you."</p>

<p>"Oh, they're coming along. Now, don't you worry,
Helen, 'cause we was all right. You don't need never
to send Mary with us," he added eagerly, "'cause we
wouldn't get drownded, nor nothing, really."</p>

<p>Jean strolled back from the other end of the veranda,
and put her hand on Helen's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Larry, love," she said, looking down at her little
brother, "your grammar is something to be deplored."</p>

<p>A fleeting smile lit up Helen's pale face and gentle
brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, here come the little culprits," she cried, starting
forward. "Gladys, my precious baby, I have
been worried to death about you. What naughty
chicks to have staid so long. Willie, I can never trust
you."</p>

<p>Willie was a grave little fellow, the eldest of the
three children.</p>

<p>"Why, Helen, we weren't gone long. Gladys was
good, and so was Larry&mdash;that is pretty&mdash;&mdash;" he added
deprecatingly. "The moment I said 'Come on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
children,' we all started; only Gladys, she couldn't
walk very fast, so Larry wouldn't wait for us. Oh,"
sighed Willie, his grave little face in a pucker at the
recollection, "I would rather Mary went along with
Gladys another time."</p>

<p>"Anyhow I was awful good, sister," lisped little
Gladys, trying to frown on Willie, "only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only your short little legs would not carry you
any quicker. Is that not so, darling? Well, since
you were all good, there is nothing to scold you
about."</p>

<p>"Helen's faith is sublime," laughed Jean, in an
aside to Nathalie.</p>

<p>Helen took little Gladys in her arms, and sat down
in a large rocker, which stood close to the front door.</p>

<p>She was a slender, frail-looking girl. Her soft,
brown hair was arranged close to her head with the
utmost simplicity, and her rather pale face would perhaps
have been plain, had it not been redeemed by a
pair of beautiful sad brown eyes. She was the eldest
of the Lawrences, and it seemed to her only a brief
time since the Angel of Death had, twice in one
short year, visited their home, leaving them bereft of
father and mother.</p>

<p>Her father had been a physician of undoubted
skill, a man of wide learning and great culture. Had
the lash of poverty given an incentive to his somewhat
lagging spirit, he might have commanded the
attention and the admiration of his fellow-men; but
his was a nature of great shyness and reserve, and
when his father died, leaving him a comfortable fortune,
he had, with an almost unconscious sigh of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
relief, turned his back on ambition and withdrawn to
the old homestead in the sleepy little town of Hetherford,
content with a small country practice which left
him undisturbed hours among his books and in his
laboratory.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence's inclinations were thoroughly social;
but so unbounded was her faith in her husband's judgment
that it never occurred to her to complain of the
narrowness and isolation of their life in Hetherford.
As her girls grew older, however, she reproached herself
with the thought that she was hardly doing them
justice in thus secluding them from the advantages of
contact with the great world which lay beyond their
own pretty village. She appeased her conscience by
giving them occasional visits to town and one long,
happy summer in Europe, which they had enjoyed to
their hearts' content.</p>

<p>The winter following this last delightful holiday,
Dr. Lawrence had been stricken with a fatal illness
and, after weeks of suffering, had passed away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence survived this blow but two months,
and at little Gladys' birth had turned to Helen with
a weary, heartbroken sigh:</p>

<p>"My darling, I am so lonely&mdash;your father. Take
care of the little ones&mdash;this wee lamb. God bless
you, my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Helen had sunk speechless at her mother's bedside,
until the sound of a wailing cry brought her once
more to herself.</p>

<p>"My dear," said gentle Aunt Helen, leaning over
her, "won't you take the poor little baby? Perhaps
she will help to comfort you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>And Helen took her little sister in her arms, and
made her way into the nursery, where, in two small
cribs, side by side, lay her little brothers, fast asleep.</p>

<p>Jean and Nathalie stood by the nursery window,
looking out into the night. At Helen's entrance they
turned sharply.</p>

<p>"O Helen, how is mamma?" Jean stopped short,
appalled at the change in her sister's face.</p>

<p>"Helen," she cried, a sharp ring of pain in her
voice, "mamma is not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jean&mdash;Nathalie&mdash;mamma is gone. Oh,
what shall we do," Helen moaned.</p>

<p>"My poor children," said Aunt Helen tenderly,
crossing the room and putting an arm around little
Nathalie, and clasping Jean's hand tightly in hers;
"your dear mamma is gone. She was so sad and
lonely without papa. Oh, darlings! do not grieve, but
think of her as happy and at rest. You, Helen, must
learn to be a mother to these little sisters and brothers,
and teach them all your dear mamma would have
them know. And Jean and even little Nathalie, too,
can help."</p>

<p>"Auntie"&mdash;Helen's tears were falling fast&mdash;"I will
do all I can. Poor baby," she whispered, and she
kissed the soft little face, which was nestled in her
arms, and then she turned toward the cribs, and looked
with loving eyes at the sleeping children. "God
bless them, and help me."</p>

<p>Since that sad night six years had rolled by.
Nathalie was now eighteen, Jean her elder by two
years, and Helen's twenty-third birthday was close at
hand. Larry and Willie were respectively eight and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
ten, and little Gladys was fast outgrowing her babyhood.</p>

<p>Aunt Helen, Mrs. Dennis, had since Mrs. Lawrence's
death made her permanent home with her
nieces and nephews. She was a sweet, gentle woman,
a widow and childless, and her lonely life had been
thus gladdened by the love of this household of happy-go-lucky
children. She had always been delicate, and
during the past few years had become so great an
invalid that she rarely left her room.</p>

<p>Thus Helen Lawrence had been obliged to assume
unusual cares and responsibilities for so young a girl,
and these were not without their effect on her mind
and character.</p>

<p>For years the manor house of Hetherford had been
in the possession of the Lawrences, and no family in
the town was better known, or more universally loved.
The manor itself was a charming old park, stretching
out far enough to make it no small walk to compass
its grounds. Grand old trees shaded the well-kept
lawns, and pretty graveled paths, lined with box-wood,
led hither and thither.</p>

<p>The house was old-fashioned in the extreme, large,
square, and commodious. A broad veranda ran around
three sides of it, and across the front there was an
upper balcony, which, in the season, was covered with
trailing vines of roses, honeysuckles, and passion
flowers. During the warm summer days this was a
favorite retreat of the girls. A few rugs were thrown
down, comfortable wicker chairs were scattered here
and there, and on the low round table in the center
there was always a motley collection of books, writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
materials, and work-baskets. Through occasional
openings in the vines were revealed pretty vistas of
lawn and flowering rosebeds, beyond which stretched
the blue waters of the sound, sparkling in the sunshine
as if strewn with a thousand jewels. It was, indeed,
an Arcadian spot.</p>

<p>Within doors everything was equally old-fashioned
and comfortable. Opening on to the broad hall,
which ran through the middle of the house, were four
large airy rooms, simply but substantially furnished,
and with an unmistakable air of being lived in. Upstairs,
in addition to the rooms occupied by the family,
each one of which was bright and cheery, and clearly
revealed the individuality of its occupant, were several
guest chambers, with heavy four-post bedsteads and
quaint mahogany dressing-tables, and during the
summer season these were rarely untenanted, for the
Lawrences' hospitality was as old-fashioned as their
home.</p>

<p>Quiet Hetherford was almost unknown as a summer
resort, but the few people who had once found their
way there came again and again, and with them all the
Lawrences were on intimate and friendly terms. It
was not strange that young men came but rarely to
this out-of-the-way little village, but a colony of girls
thrived and were happy there; happier, perhaps, for
this very lack of the masculine element. The girls
often laughed merrily over it, and no one of them
seemed to take it very much to heart, save pretty little
dark-eyed Emily Varian, who spent her summers with
her uncle, Dr. Evelyn Birdsall, the Presbyterian
minister.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>"It is deplorable," she sighed, "and if the girls
were not selfishly lazy they could quite easily get some
men to come out here. Certainly town is not so far
off as to make us quite out of the world. It is nothing
but stupid nonsense and vanity on the girls' part.
They think it is something fine and independent never
to see anything of men. For my part, I should think
they would be ashamed of it."</p>

<p>There was one girl who always laughed good-humoredly
at Emily's grumbling, and she was none
other than charming Eleanor Hill. However, she had
less cause to complain, for while Emily went from her
winter home in one little country town to sleepier
Hetherford for the summer months, Miss Hill for
more than half of every year led the gayest of lives in
New York. When June came with its warm sunshine
and long days, she and her mother gladly
turned their face toward pretty, dreamy Hetherford;
to them the dearest spot in the world.</p>

<p>Mollie Andrews said that, for her part, she didn't
care. Taking it all in all, she did not see but that they
had a pretty good time. The Andrews had been
coming to Hetherford for years, and were all deeply
attached to the place; Mollie's handsome, scatterbrained
brother Dick had set the seal of his approval
on their choice of a summer resort, and thenceforth
Mollie would have deemed it nothing short of heresy
to call the place stupid. To be sure, Dick rarely
turned up oftener than once a week, but then her
cousin Clifford Archer, nicknamed "the fatal beauty,"
was wont to put in an appearance for a few days,
frequently with his great chum Wendell Churchill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
whose yacht was quite a familiar object in Hetherford
Harbor.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly absurd of Emily," Mollie would
end, with a toss of her head.</p>

<p>Emily always looked scornful, and Nan Birdsall,
happy-go-lucky Nan, who rarely went away from
Hetherford, would laugh gleefully.</p>

<p>"Poor Em," she exclaimed one evening, after one
of her cousin's tirades, "you are man-crazy. Never
mind, dear; you wait. I know a thing or two, and
by and by when my ship comes in," looking around at
the girls, with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, "you
will be surprised. Perhaps we will have more men
here than we have bargained for."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Nan?" they cried in chorus;
but not a bit of satisfaction would Nan give them.</p>

<p>The parsonage adjoined the manor, and an opening
in the hedge made intercourse between the two
families an easy matter. Just across the road was the
inn, where all the summer visitors stayed, and a
quainter retreat could not be imagined. They formed
only a small circle of people, but many were the happy
times they had together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
NAN'S SHIP ARRIVES.</h2>

<p class="p2">"I wonder why we couldn't have a swim this
morning, Jean?" Nathalie stood before her
mirror, arranging her pretty brown tresses which, in
spite of vigorous efforts with brush and comb, would
curl, and refuse to be orderly. "Of course, Aunt
Helen will say it is too early in the season."</p>

<p>"Well, I think that is absurd. It is warm enough.
'Afric's sunny clime' is not a circumstance to it.
Look out, Jean, at the sunlight on the lawn. When
it has that pinkish tinge, you may be sure it's hot."</p>

<p>Jean peeped through the half-open shutters.</p>

<p>"Oh! what a sweet day. Yes, it is going to be
hot, and, unless Aunt Helen objects seriously, we will
surely go in."</p>

<p>She crossed the room and, opening the wardrobe
door, took out a pretty striped cotton gown. "Warm
enough for this, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Nathalie nodded.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the girls were both in the
dining room. Helen and the children were already
at breakfast.</p>

<p>"How late you are," cried Helen, looking up from
an open letter. "I wish you&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," interrupted Nathalie. "It will
all be the same a hundred years hence."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I suppose so," sighed Helen. "Gladys,
don't beat on the table with your spoon. The noise
is distracting."</p>

<p>"And although your tones are dulcet, my love,
suppose you give us that little song after breakfast,"
and Jean slipped into her place at her little sister's side.</p>

<p>Gladys turned and threw her arms around her.</p>

<p>"I didn't see you come in, Jeanie."</p>

<p>"That is because you have not eyes in the back of
your head, pet."</p>

<p>"Of course I haven't. Nobody has, 'cept fairies
and princesses, I s'pose," and Gladys straightened
herself up, and, in so doing, overturned her glass of
milk into her lap.</p>

<p>"Gladys," cried Helen sharply, "look at your nice,
clean frock. It is a shame."</p>

<p>The little girl's lips trembled, and her bright blue
eye overflowed with tears.</p>

<p>"You don't s'pose I did it a-purpose&mdash;for nothing."</p>

<p>"No, no, dear. Of course not. Don't cry. I
didn't mean to scold you. There, get down and run
up to Mary, like a good little girl, and have your
frock changed," for the sight of tears always put an
end to Helen's best efforts at severity.</p>

<p>But Gladys' feelings had been hurt, and now that
she was mistress of the situation, she had no intention
of drying her eyes.</p>

<p>"I think you were unkind, Helen," she began
plaintively.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be a baby, Gladys," interposed Nathalie
irritably. "I declare, I think it a perfect nuisance
to have our breakfast spoiled in this way. If you
can't behave, you had better have yours in the nursery."</p>

<p>The child's tears were about to begin afresh when a
pleasant voice was heard at the door.</p>

<p>"Good-morning. Can I come in?" And without
awaiting permission Miss Hill crossed the room. In
her pretty flannel gown and garden hat she made a
very pleasing picture. "How are you, puss?" And
she stooped and kissed little Gladys' tear-stained
cheek, smiling meanwhile at the girls, as she divined
the situation.</p>

<p>"All right," said the little girl, her face brightening
perceptibly, for she dearly loved Miss Hill.</p>

<p>"Helen, here is a rose," said Eleanor, "and
when you smell it you will realize that June is
here."</p>

<p>Helen smiled her thanks.</p>

<p>"Well, Eleanor, what started you so early?" asked
Jean, as she buttered her roll.</p>

<p>"Early? You girls don't know what early means.
Why it is after nine and I had my breakfast a good
hour ago."</p>

<p>"Horror!" shuddered Nathalie. "The very
thought is pain."</p>

<p>"They are spoiled," spoke Helen, "and even I am
getting into bad habits. I simply gave up struggling,
and set the breakfast hour a half hour later, with the
desperate hope that it might bring them down on
time."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>"Girls, you ought to be ashamed," said Eleanor,
with well-feigned reproach in her tone.</p>

<p>"What nonsense! You would do exactly the same
yourself if Mrs. Moffins were not such a disciplinarian.
You can't make me think you are so superior,"
laughed Nathalie.</p>

<p>Helen rose, and, pushing open the blind door,
stepped out on the veranda. It was a beautiful June
morning, bright and sunshiny. The air was soft and
warm, and the gentle south wind felt like a caress.
The fragrance of roses and honeysuckles was almost intoxicating.
Every now and then the delicious stillness
was broken by the soft plaintive song of a bird.
The old manor looked more beautiful than ever to
Helen, who loved every nook and cranny of it. She
stood for a moment, shading her eyes with her hand
from the sun.</p>

<p>"What a pretty day," she murmured to herself.
"Oh, I wish&mdash;&mdash;" but then a voice called her, and she
went back into the house.</p>

<p>"Helen," said Jean, coming out from the dining
room, "ask Auntie if we can go in bathing. It is so
warm, and we are wild to go in."</p>

<p>"Very well," nodded Helen, as she went upstairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dennis was in her chair by the window, with
her breakfast tray on a small table at her side.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, darling," she said cheerily.
"Where did these delicious strawberries come from?"
glancing at the pretty cut-glass dish which was filled
with them.</p>

<p>"They are the first out of the garden, Auntie, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
was determined that no one should have them but
your own dear self."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear, it was just like you to think
of Auntie first. I shall indeed enjoy them."</p>

<p>"Do please; and oh, Auntie! the girls want to go
bathing to-day. Are you willing they should?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid the water will be cold."</p>

<p>"Well, we have had a good deal of warm weather,
and I think it can't be very frigid. I suppose we
might as well say 'yes,' Auntie?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Aunt Helen laughingly.
"Past experience has taught us that when Jean and
Nathalie have set their hearts on a thing, we might as
well surrender at once. You won't go in, dear?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," and Helen shivered at the idea.
"I must go and tell the girls, for they will want to
know."</p>

<p>When the roomy buckboard came to the door,
Nathalie jumped into the front seat and gathered up
the reins.</p>

<p>"Hurry and get in, girls," she called. "The
horses are very fresh this morning," and in a moment
more they were bowling down the avenue.</p>

<p>"Stop at the inn, Nat," said Jean, "and we will get
the letters, and ask Mollie to go down to the beach
with us."</p>

<p>As they pulled up before the inn, Mollie Andrews
came running out on to the porch, with a package of
letters in her hand.</p>

<p>"Don't get out, Jean; I have your mail. Have
you got room enough for me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Jump right in," cried Nathalie. "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
tide is just right now, so we must hurry. Oh! isn't
this jolly? I love the delicious sense of excitement
one always feels at the first swim of the season. Say,
Moll, will you go in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Yes, I think I will."</p>

<p>It was quite a pretty scene, this bright June morning,
down on the little stretch of sands which Hetherford
dignified by the name of "The Beach."</p>

<p>Little children were digging in the sand and filling
their pails, and some of the small boys were running
up and down, now in the water, and now out.
The girls were in a group in front of the bathing
houses, all chattering at once, and discussing the momentous
question as to whether to make the plunge
or not.</p>

<p>In a brief time Jean and Nathalie were swimming
far out, and Mollie came creeping timidly to the
water's edge.</p>

<p>"Oh! how I dread it," she laughed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Moll; go ahead. It will do you good."</p>

<p>Mollie walked off, and Helen and Eleanor, who
had found a sheltered nook, watched the bathers for
a while in silence. By and by Helen's gaze strayed
from the bathers to the stretch of blue water beyond,
and a slightly troubled look crept into her eyes. A
sudden, deep sigh recalled Eleanor's thoughts to her
companion.</p>

<p>"Why, Helen, what world of melancholy does that
sigh proclaim?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," evasively. "I am low-spirited
this morning, somehow or other."</p>

<p>"Can't you tell me the reason, dear?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>Helen did not answer, and for a moment Eleanor
watched her closely. Something in the delicate face
and in the eyes, in which, of late, a shadow always
lurked, touched her.</p>

<p>"I would love your confidence, Helen," she said at
last; "but unless you can give it to me freely, I
would not wish to ask it of you."</p>

<p>Helen stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, for a moment I thought to speak to you
of something troublesome, but be glad, dear, that I
have changed my mind. I am going to speak of
something pleasant instead. Do you remember my
friend Miss Stuart? She has visited me several
times, but always in the winter."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I remember Jean's writing me about
her."</p>

<p>Helen turned a questioning glance on Eleanor,
but the girl's expression was perfectly non-committal.</p>

<p>"Yes? Well, she is coming here to visit me later.
The time is not set as yet, but I hope it will be early
next month."</p>

<p>"Indeed. How nice. But, Helen, I thought she
was very gay and devoted to society. What will she
do in this colony of girls, with scarcely a man to say
a pretty thing to her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Helen, a shade of annoyance
crossing her face. "I think, perhaps, the girls
may be mistaken about her. I feel quite sure she will
be happy here."</p>

<p>Just then Nan Birdsall came rushing down over the
sands, warm but radiant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>"Going in, Nan?" called Eleanor in greeting.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," breathlessly. "I hate the water
more than a cat does," and Nan dropped down on
the sand at Eleanor's side, and, taking off her hat,
fanned her flushed face.</p>

<p>"Where is Em this morning?" queried Helen.</p>

<p>"What a superfluous question," laughed Nan.
"Don't you see that the <i>Sylph</i> is in the harbor?
Of course, Em has Mr. Churchill in tow."</p>

<p>"How will Nathalie like that?" asked Eleanor
with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nat won't care," replied Nan, picking up a
pebble and sending it skimming across the water.
"She is far too sensible."</p>

<p>"Look over your shoulder, Nan, and see your prediction
verified;" and surely enough, strolling across
the beach, in their direction, came Emily Varian, with
Wendell Churchill at her side.</p>

<p>"Isn't Em in her element?" said Nan, lowering
her voice.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more characteristic than
the welcome the three girls gave Mr. Churchill. Into
Eleanor Hill's courteous greeting was thrown just
enough of personal interest as to be slightly flattering.
Helen's "How do you do" was both shy and reserved,
and Nan just nodded indifferently, and continued her
occupation of skipping stones.</p>

<p>"We ought to be going home," announced Helen
presently.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the girls are not ready yet? Oh, yes!
there they come!" as the three girls came down
from the bathing house and joined the little group.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Suddenly Nan dropped her pebbles and sprang to her
feet with an exclamation:</p>

<p>"Oh, girls, what fun! My ship has come in at
last!"</p>

<p>"Why, Nan, are you going out of your mind?"
cried Jean. "What ship?"</p>

<p>"Look, girls, look! Don't you see that big
schooner just rounding the point?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what of it?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the U. S. Coast Survey schooner
<i>Vortex</i>, and she's going to be stationed here for a
long time, and Dick knows all the officers aboard.
How is that for a piece of news?"</p>

<p>"This must be your secret," laughed Eleanor.</p>

<p>"Of course, and didn't I keep it well? Dick told
me weeks ago that they were coming."</p>

<p>"I say, it is jolly. We will have some fun, won't
we?" It was Nathalie who spoke.</p>

<p>"It is a perfect god-send," declared Emily Varian,
solemnly. "Nan, your secret is a success, and I congratulate
you."</p>

<p>"I wonder," ruminated Jean, "who the men are,
and whether we will really like them."</p>

<p>"Time will tell," spoke Helen, a bit indifferently.
"Come, girls, we must be going. Here is the
carriage."</p>

<p>Almost every evening the young people gathered
together on the Lawrences' broad veranda, and to-night
was no exception to the rule. When the girls
strolled out from the dining room, they found Nan
and Emily sitting on the steps.</p>

<p>"Why, we never heard you at all," said Jean. "You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
must have come over the lawn like&mdash;oh dear, I can't
think of a comparison. The night is too warm for
one to exert one's brain unnecessarily."</p>

<p>Nathalie seated herself on the railing.</p>

<p>"Here come Eleanor and Wendell Churchill."</p>

<p>"Ah!" laughed Jean teasingly. Her sister looked
around at her with heightened color.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Jean."</p>

<p>"Do you know I have hardly seen you to-day, Miss
Nathalie," said Churchill, finding a place on the railing
at her side. "Where have you kept yourself?"</p>

<p>"Everywhere&mdash;anywhere. I have not been hard
to find."</p>

<p>Nathalie's eyes were smiling wickedly into his, and
his gave her back a smile.</p>

<p>"Now, let me explain," he began.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let me put you to any unnecessary
trouble," she interrupted with mock formality.</p>

<p>"You are very cruel to-night," said Churchill
laughing. "By the way, Dick and I went down to
the <i>Vortex</i> this afternoon, and there are some
awfully good fellows aboard. I hope you girls will
give them a good time."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that the responsibility ought to
rest with them," interposed Eleanor Hill.</p>

<p>"Otherwise we should feel absolutely overwhelmed,"
said Nan comically.</p>

<p>"Here comes Dick now," exclaimed Nathalie, "and
he has a strange man with him."</p>

<p>In a moment more Dick Andrews gained the veranda,
and introduced his friend Beverly Dudley, of
the <i>Vortex</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>It was Jean who came forward and, extending her
hand, bade him welcome.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Dudley, I fear you will feel yourself
overwhelmed with such a bevy of girls, but let me
help you. This is my sister Nathalie&mdash;my friends
Miss Hill, Miss Birdsall, and Miss Varian. Unfortunately
my elder sister is not here to receive you.
She will join us presently. Emily, can't you make
room for Mr. Dudley on the settle?" she added
glancing about her.</p>

<p>Emily smiled radiantly, and Dudley, who seemed to
be a charming youth, made his way to her side.</p>

<p>Leaving Nathalie and Em each happy in a <i>tête-à-tête</i>,
the other girls formed a circle of which jolly
Dick was the center, and much good-natured chaffing
and light-hearted laughter were in order.</p>

<p>After a while Helen appeared in the doorway with
two mandolins in her hands.</p>

<p>"What a good idea," exclaimed Eleanor enthusiastically.
"Now we can have some singing."</p>

<p>"I can't very well shake hands, Mr. Dudley," said
Helen, in response to Jean's introduction.</p>

<p>"Let me relieve you, Miss Lawrence."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Will you give this mandolin to my sister
Nathalie?"</p>

<p>They all joined in a song, and their voices, with the
mandolin accompaniment, sounded wondrously sweet
in the soft night air.</p>

<p>It was growing late when Nan at last jumped up.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to break up the party, but Emily and I
must be going. Father will have the town crier out
pretty soon."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>There was a general move, and Mr. Dudley crossed
to Helen's side.</p>

<p>"I have had a charming evening, Miss Lawrence.
I hope you will honor us with your presence on the
<i>Vortex</i> very soon." He spoke with the soft drawl
peculiar to Southerners.</p>

<p>"It will be a great pleasure, and indeed we will."</p>

<p>"Won't you let me walk home with you, Miss
Varian?" he asked. "It is rather late for you to
go alone."</p>

<p>Emily's answer was lost in a merry peal of laughter
from Nan.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dudley evidently appreciates the dangers
lurking in that desolate stretch of lawn between here
and the parsonage," she said with good-natured sarcasm.</p>

<p>The girls joined in a general laugh, in spite of themselves,
but Emily frowned portentously.</p>

<p>After "good-night" had been said all around, and
Helen found herself alone in her room, she took out
from between the leaves of a book the letter she had
received in the morning. As she re-read it she
glanced up from time to time at a likeness which
stood on the table close at hand. It was the face of
a very beautiful woman&mdash;a face delicate, oval in shape,
with straight eyebrows, from under which looked out a
pair of eyes with a world of witchery in their depths;
the whole crowned by a halo of soft hair.</p>

<p>Helen dropped the letter in her lap, and folding her
hands over it, fell into a deep reverie. Rousing herself
at last, she slowly crossed the room, and opened
a little drawer in her writing desk. There, hidden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
among some papers, lay another photograph&mdash;a man's
face this time. As she looked at it steadily a heavy
sigh escaped her lips, for it seemed to her that the
grave eyes looked at her reproachfully. With a half-impatient
exclamation she tossed it back into its hiding-place
and closed the drawer sharply, and not
until sleep claimed her did these two faces fade entirely
from her mental vision.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
A LEAF FROM HELEN'S PAST.</h2>

<p class="p2">Many years before the opening of this story the
Lawrence children counted among their dearest
friends a certain pleasant-faced, sturdy little chap,
Guy Appleton by name, who never considered a day
quite complete unless at least a part of it was spent
at the hospitable manor. His own pretty home, Rose
Cottage, lay only a stone's throw away, and there the
little Lawrence girls passed many a happy hour. Mrs.
Appleton and Mrs. Lawrence had been schoolgirls
together, and the flight of years had but strengthened
their friendship. Mrs. Appleton was delighted that
her shy little son had found such pleasant companions,
and in every way encouraged his intercourse with
them. The Lawrences were all dear to Guy's boyish
heart, but none held quite the same place as Helen.
She had been especially kind and friendly to him,
and for her his affection was particularly deep and
adoring.</p>

<p>The years, as they rolled by, served but to increase
his love for his little playmate, and from his allegiance
to her he never swerved. When his college days
were over and he was about to sail for Europe on an
extended tour, he found it impossible to say farewell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
without speaking to her of the subject which lay
nearest his heart.</p>

<p>Helen was very young and inexperienced, and these
were the first words of love to which she had ever
listened. Her tender heart was deeply touched, and
Guy went away gladdened by her shy expression of
sorrow at his departure, and by the whispered "Yes"
that her lips spoke falteringly.</p>

<p>Helen had accepted her youthful lover, and many
were the rejoicings among the small Hetherford circle
over what they termed Helen's engagement; although
the girl herself looked a little grave over so serious a
term. At the manor the new relationship was accepted
gladly, for it seemed only a fitting ending to Guy's
long friendship in their family.</p>

<p>Three years slipped by; years in which Guy bent
every energy to the study of architecture, which he
had chosen as his profession. He had decided talent,
and by continued assiduity was making a name for
himself among his colleagues.</p>

<p>Little change had taken place in Hetherford except
such as the flight of time must necessarily bring.
Helen was now quite a woman, with a pretty air of
gravity which the new cares had lent to her.</p>

<p>When finally, one crisp October day, Guy walked in
upon them, his face bronzed by the recent ocean
trip, his slender figure grown broad and strong, his
blue eyes beaming with happiness, he was welcomed
with the greatest warmth of affection, and as they sat
about the crackling flames in the manor hall his long
absence seemed almost a dream.</p>

<p>It was during the following winter that Helen had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
her first misgivings as to her real feeling for Guy.
Indeed, sometimes, her engagement oppressed her
strangely, and she was assailed by an overwhelming
longing to be free.</p>

<p>Women are indeed incomprehensible, and when the
largess of their love is not given, it is rare, save
through some sharp lesson, that they appreciate to
the full the men whose hearts they possess. In this
Helen was, perhaps, in nowise different from the
rest of her sex. Be this as it may, Guy's unchanging
love and devotion sometimes wearied her, and failed
to call forth an answering love in her own heart. Yet
the months glided by, and she had not the courage
to tell her lover the truth. She was not always successful
in hiding it from him, however, and once or
twice a faint suspicion of her indifference came to
him.</p>

<p>The summer came and went, and almost a year had
drifted by since his return. Guy finally broached the
subject of marriage.</p>

<p>At his first words Helen was filled with dismay, and
as she listened with down-bent head and averted eyes,
Guy was suddenly conscious of a great lack in her
love for him, and a sense of foreboding swept over him.
To his long and pleading request that a time might
be set for their marriage, Helen put forth the children's
claim upon her; and when he gently urged her
to reconsider her determination, she answered him so
sharply and curtly that he yielded, convinced that it
would be unwise to press the matter any further.</p>

<p>Helen's lips had almost formed the words "Guy, I
do not love you as I should," but her lover's face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
pale with grief at her all too evident reluctance,
robbed her of the needful courage.</p>

<p>Guy was not a man of half measures, and, having
accepted Helen's decision, resolutely put out of his
mind his painful doubts, and trusted to the future to
strengthen her love for him. She was greatly touched
by his generosity and half ashamed of the stand she
had taken, and now that the question of marriage was
indefinitely postponed, persuaded herself that she was
deeply attached to him, and that it would have been
both cruel and unwise to have broken her engagement.</p>

<p>In September Guy took his vacation and, his
mother having volunteered to go to the mountains
with him, he induced Helen to accompany them.
She had many qualms of conscience at leaving the
children, but the invitation was a tempting one, and
she had not the heart to disappoint her lover a second
time. So, after strict injunctions to Mary, and
urgent entreaties to Jean and Nathalie, she started
off.</p>

<p>It was a delightful holiday for all three. Mrs.
Appleton, who had no thought for anyone but her
son, was overjoyed to see him in such high spirits, for
of late she had thought him both sad and depressed;
and Guy felt that his happiness was quite complete, for
never had he had Helen so much to himself, and never
had she been so frankly affectionate and sweet with
him. The days glided by like a dream, even to Helen.
She had thrust all worry and anxiety from her, and
entered with eager interest and zest into all the plans
for their pleasant journeyings. If now and then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
found herself a bit wearied by Guy's unceasing attentions,
she strenuously hid the fact from him and
called herself strictly to account for the unworthy
thought.</p>

<p>It was at a hotel on the borders of a beautiful lake
that Helen first saw Lillian Stuart. One morning
Guy had gone off fishing, and as Mrs. Appleton was
writing letters in the seclusion of her room, Helen
took her book and wandered out into the grounds in
search of a cool, shady spot where she could read in
peace. Coming at length upon a retired nook, she
found herself forestalled, for, comfortably ensconced
under the shade of a great willow, was a woman so
beautiful that, as Helen caught sight of her, she could
scarce repress an exclamation. The girl looked up,
and their eyes met. Helen shyly dropped hers and
passed quickly on, but that brief glimpse left a vivid
impression upon her mind of a well-poised head,
crowned with the most wonderful auburn hair, of a
face dazzlingly fair, and a pair of deep violet
eyes.</p>

<p>All day long Helen's thoughts reverted to this vision,
and that afternoon, when Guy returned from his fishing,
she gave him a glowing description of her encounter.</p>

<p>Just before dinner, while they were standing together
in the corridor, the girl came toward them on
her way to the dining room. Helen laid her hand
impulsively on her lover's arm.</p>

<p>"Please look, Guy," she whispered. "Here she
comes. Isn't she beautiful? Why, Guy," excitedly,
"do you know her? She is bowing to you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that the woman you mean?" he asked, when he
had gravely returned her bow.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Where did you ever know her?"</p>

<p>"I met her at Baden, when I was over there."</p>

<p>"How strange," said Helen musingly. "Why did
you never tell me about her?"</p>

<p>"Because I never liked her," he replied with
decision, "and I trust you and she will not meet."</p>

<p>A curiously unaccountable feeling of resentment
swept across Helen.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there is much chance of it," she
returned coldly.</p>

<p>It is the unexpected that happens; for one afternoon,
only a few days later, as Helen stood talking
with some friends on the broad hotel veranda, Miss
Stuart joined the group and, before Helen had hardly
appreciated the situation, an introduction had ensued.</p>

<p>In spite of Guy's protests a friendship sprang up
between the two girls. It seemed to him that there
was something almost pointed in the way Helen
ignored his request, and followed up this acquaintance,
to which he had so strenuously objected. Helen was
not only fascinated and charmed by Miss Stuart's
meteor-like brilliance, but felt, moreover, the keenest
annoyance at the masterful way in which Guy had
laid his injunctions upon her. He had maintained a
strict reticence concerning his reasons, giving her no
further explanation than that the friendship ran counter
to his wishes. Helen's defiance was aroused, and
perhaps a growing sense of <i>ennui</i> in her lover's society
increased the temptation to welcome eagerly any new
interest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Stuart had a well-defined motive
in trying to secure Helen's friendship, and an even
stronger desire to lessen Guy's influence with the girl.
Whatever her past acquaintance with Guy had been,
it would have been apparent to anyone less easily
deceived than Helen, that she bore him no good will.</p>

<p>The rest of the holiday time, which had begun so
happily, was spoiled for Guy, and he was relieved
when at length their faces were turned toward home,
feeling sure that a separation from Miss Stuart was
all that was necessary to awaken Helen's loyalty to
him and to put an end to what he considered a most
unfortunate episode in the girl's life. To his deep
sorrow their return did not accomplish his expectations,
for not only had a correspondence been begun
between the girls, but Helen's whole bearing toward
him changed completely, and her manner was both
cold and distant. Finally, one evening, she came to
him, and, after a few preliminaries, announced her intention
of visiting Miss Stuart at her home in town.
This brief announcement aroused Guy's quick temper,
and before he realized what had happened, bitter
words had been spoken, and Helen had swept out of
the room.</p>

<p>The following day she left for town. When a week
had passed without a line from her, Guy could endure
it no longer and sought an interview, battling with
his indignation at the thought that it must take place
under Miss Stuart's roof.</p>

<p>Many a time afterward he tried to recall the exact
words that were spoken on that memorable occasion,
but everything seemed unreal to him, save Helen's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
face, pale with the determination not to accede to his
wishes. Finally, he could recall asking her if she
desired her freedom. Alas, poor Guy! The quick
spontaneity of her response shattered his last hope.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, Guy, please. We will be so much
better friends, then."</p>

<p>"Friends!" he echoed bitterly; "after all these
years."</p>

<p>Helen put her hand on his shoulder, but he gently
pushed her from him.</p>

<p>"It is as well I should know the truth now as later.
You do not love me, Helen. There is nothing left
now, but for us to part."</p>

<p>When he was leaving a sudden recollection came to
him of the cause of all this unhappiness, and crushing
down his own bitterness, he endeavored in quiet and
carefully chosen words to dissuade her from a friendship
which he feared she would rue, but she maintained
an almost unbroken silence, and the expression
of her face told him that his warning was of no avail.
So they parted.</p>

<p>Guy was more than justified in his distrust of
Lillian Stuart. Had he been a man of less delicate
sense of honor he could have righted himself in
Helen's eyes by simply relating to her some incontrovertible
facts; but the circumstances which had given
him his knowledge sealed his lips.</p>

<p>While at college, the name, Lillian Stuart, had
grown familiar to him, through hearing her praises
sounded by his chum Nelson Leonard. The year
after their graduation they ran across each other at
Baden, and their college friendship was resumed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Guy was not long in discovering that there was something
radically wrong with his friend, and the cause,
which all Baden apparently understood, was soon
made clear to him.</p>

<p>Among the most noted people frequenting Baden
at this time, were a Mrs. Ogden-Stuart and her beautiful
daughter. It had been understood on their
arrival that Miss Stuart was engaged to the good-looking
American, Mr. Leonard, who was traveling in
their party. This fact, however, did not seem to stand
in the way of her flirting openly with every eligible
man in the place, nor prevent her from receiving their
constant homage. Leonard was evidently wretched,
and there was a touch of recklessness in his manner,
which, Guy felt, boded no good to a man of his highly
strung, sensitive nature. For a week after Guy's
arrival things drifted on, but there was something in
the air that seemed to foretell a crisis. Guy had been
presented to Miss Stuart, but in spite of her beauty
and fascination found nothing in her to like or
respect. This Miss Stuart felt instinctively, and as
she was accustomed to admiration, it stung her into
a desire to win something more than indifference from
Leonard's friend. Her efforts were totally unsuccessful,
and, as her treatment of her lover became less and
less loyal, Guy withdrew altogether from her society,
showing her no further courtesy than an occasional bow
of recognition. In the meantime Miss Stuart's latest
affair, with a certain Frenchman of unenviable reputation,
was giving Baden food for gossip and keeping
it on the <i>qui vive</i> for a scandal.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon, while Guy sat on the veranda
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
reading letters from home, Miss Stuart and Leonard
passed him. The girl's face wore a mocking smile,
her eyes a taunt; Leonard was white as death, and his
lips twitched piteously. Guy's own face grew stern
as he looked up at them, and when Miss Stuart threw
him a careless word in salutation he could scarcely
frame a civil reply.</p>

<p>That evening Leonard went to Guy's room, and
flinging himself down in a chair, gave voice for the
first time to his misery.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Appleton," he exclaimed, with a hard
laugh, "I shall throw up the game pretty soon. I
may be a coward; but it takes more courage than I
have to face this thing any longer."</p>

<p>Guy was more startled than he cared to reveal by
his friend's passionate, despairing vehemence; and he
made an effort to treat the matter lightly and to
divert Leonard's thoughts, but his efforts were not
crowned with success. When Leonard had left him
he paced up and down the room, revolving in his
mind what step he should take. At length he determined
to go to Miss Stuart, and appeal to her,
hoping that so direct a course would result favorably.</p>

<p>He began the interview awkwardly, feeling that his
presumption was almost unwarrantable, but when she
met his earnest plea for his friend first with indifference,
and then with undisguised amusement, he found
his anger rising.</p>

<p>"I do not think you can realize Leonard's condition
of mind, Miss Stuart," he said darkly. "If you
would only put an end to this once for all, I am sure
that he is man enough to go away from you and try
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
to live down his disappointment; but he has a peculiarly
excitable and sensitive temperament, and if you
continue to torture him in this way, I fear you will
have his death at your door."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say," she replied lightly, "that our
friend is a fool now," looking up at him with a
glance strangely deep and subtle, "if he were half
the man you are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have nothing further to say," Guy interrupted,
flushing with indignation and disgust, and without
another word he abruptly left her.</p>

<p>Two days later all Baden was shocked by the startling
news that young Nelson Leonard had accidentally
shot himself and was lying at the point of death.</p>

<p>Those melancholy hours of watching by Leonard's
bedside, in that dreary hotel room, lived in Guy's
memory. When the doctor's sad verdict was pronounced,
the dying man pleaded to be left alone with
his friend.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear old fellow," he said gently, when they
were alone, "pretty well done&mdash;for an accident?
Forgive me," he murmured, as he caught a sharp look
of pain in Guy's face. "Forgive&mdash;&mdash;" his voice
faltered, and his head fell wearily back on the pillow.</p>

<p>Then the poor boy's mind wandered, and Lillian
Stuart's name was constantly on his lips. In broken,
halting sentences a pitiful story of deception and disappointment
was revealed to Guy&mdash;a story which
would be sacred to him to his life's end, and, as he
listened, his whole soul revolted against the woman
who had so willfully trifled with this man's tender,
loyal heart. Before morning dawned, Nelson Leonard's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
eyes had closed forever on a life which he had
found too difficult for him. When the sad affair was
over, Guy would fain have left Baden at once, but he
was obliged to await there the arrival of Leonard's
family from America.</p>

<p>In the days that ensued Lillian Stuart was markedly
subdued, but if she had any suspicion of the real
truth concerning Leonard's death she never betrayed
it by word or look. She did all in her power to overcome
Guy's aversion for her, but he sternly repulsed
her. To attempt conciliation was a new rôle for Miss
Stuart, and his cold disregard of all her efforts was
the severest wound her vanity had ever received.</p>

<p>Such a slight is not readily forgiven or forgotten
by a woman of her type. So when Guy Appleton
once more crossed her path, and she found, in his
deep love for Helen, his vulnerable point, she felt
that her day of triumph had come.</p>

<p>It had been an easy task to secure Helen's friendship,
and then to so use her influence with the girl
as to effect the annulling of the engagement. Miss
Stuart knew Guy's nature well enough to feel almost
sure that, however sorely he might be tempted, he
would probably never betray his knowledge of that
unpleasant episode in her past; so, trading on the
man's very uprightness, she revenged herself for the
bitter sting of wounded vanity that rankled in her
memory.</p>

<p>Her well-planned scheme had been marvelously
successful, but one unlooked-for element had entered
into it; for Helen's simplicity and purity of nature,
her lack of vanity, coquetry, or duplicity, above all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
her entire confidence and trust, had touched a tender
chord in the heart of this cold and worldly woman, and
were in themselves a power so great she felt herself
held by them. Could she have foreseen the future,
she would, perhaps, have struggled against this most
disturbing element.</p>

<p>Guy's return to Hetherford with the announcement
that his engagement was at an end, and that he was
going immediately abroad, created quite a ferment
among the good people at the manor and Rose
Cottage, and many were their fruitless conjectures as
to the cause of Helen's sudden change of feeling.
Across at the parsonage, happy-go-lucky Nan puckered
up her jolly face, pondered long over this vexatious
question, and hit at last upon the correct solution
of it, but wisely kept her own counsel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Appleton took her son's disappointment very
much to heart, and when Helen came home again
Rose Cottage was closed and its occupants once more
gone abroad. When the buckboard rolled by the
deserted little place Helen drew her breath sharply,
then, catching Jean's reproachful eyes upon her, began
hurriedly to speak of other things. The Lawrences
frankly avowed to her their regret and disappointment,
but not one word of explanation did the girl
vouchsafe to them, so after a little they accepted the
inevitable, and Guy's name was no longer spoken
among them.</p>

<p>And thus it was that of the Lawrence girls, Helen
alone had the proud distinction of having had a
genuine love affair, the memory of which, however,
was tinged with deep regret, and caused her naught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
but pain. Perhaps she felt intuitively that she had
done wrong. What was a pleasant friendship compared
to the love of a true man's heart? Yet the
thought of a marriage with Guy was out of the
question.</p>

<p>So the foolish girl reasoned. Time brings many
changes, however, and perhaps what once seemed to
Helen a catastrophe may one day seem to open the
very gates of Paradise.</p>

<p>And now that we have taken a leaf from Helen's
past, let us resume our way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
A SAIL ON THE "CYCLONE."</h2>

<p class="p2">"They have hired the dear old <i>Cyclone</i>, Helen,
because the men thought the wind was bound to
be light to-day and we would have so much more
sport in a small boat than on the <i>Vortex</i>."</p>

<p>Nathalie stood in the doorway, gesticulating eagerly
with her slender brown hands. Her pretty face was
quite flushed with excitement, and her hurried words
tripped over each other in their anxiety to be spoken.</p>

<p>"You see we must make haste, for Dick says we
must be at the dock at eleven, or we won't catch the
tide."</p>

<p>"But what about luncheon?" interposed Helen
quietly.</p>

<p>A comical expression of dismay crossed Nathalie's
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I suppose you will want to kill us; but
Jean and I, in a sudden fit of enthusiasm, said we
would attend to that, and not one thing have we
done yet."</p>

<p>"Did you think to provide any cold meat for sandwiches?"
demanded the young housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there are three stout chickens, some
cold corned beef, and a 'bit of ham bone,' as
Bridget puts it, gracing your larder."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we haven't a moment to spare, so call Jean,
and let us get right to work."</p>

<p>The pile of sandwiches grew rapidly under the
girls' deft hands, and little Larry, wandering in from
the veranda, looked longingly at these interesting
preparations.</p>

<p>"Wish I could go with you," he ventured, with
sudden courage.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of it," replied Helen emphatically, as
she ran out of the room to get a fresh supply of bread.</p>

<p>"Guess you'll all be drownded, anyway," and Larry
eyed them with a superior and triumphant mien.</p>

<p>"That's right, my cheerful little brother," laughed
Jean. "Always look on the bright side of things."</p>

<p>"Now, when shall we tell Aunt Helen we will be
back?" asked Nathalie, as they were fitting the cover
down on the well-filled hamper.</p>

<p>"Not later than five, I should think."</p>

<p>"Don't let's commit ourselves, Helen," suggested
Jean. "It is such a bore, and we will be troubling
about it all the afternoon."</p>

<p>"We must be home by five; I am not willing to
leave the children any longer than that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can manage the wind to suit your
own purposes. You know it generally plays more or
less of a part in sailing," and Jean gave a vicious tug
at the last unfastened strap.</p>

<p>"Don't be impertinent, Jean," Nathalie called out,
as she ran swiftly upstairs. "Never mind, Helen,
her youth is her only excuse."</p>

<p>"All the same, we shall be home on time if possible,
dearie."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>Jean laughed good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"I am always disagreeable," she admitted, "when
anyone speaks with decision. I don't know why, but
it sets my teeth on edge."</p>

<p>Dudley met them at the wharf with the cutter from
the <i>Vortex</i>, and soon they were pulling swiftly out
to the <i>Cyclone's</i> mooring. As they rounded the stern
of the old oyster sloop, a young man was seen standing
at the wheel, his slender figure held firmly erect,
one hand shading his eyes as he scanned the blue
waters of the sound.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" whispered Mollie.</p>

<p>"Up oars!" cried Dudley, intent on bringing the
cutter up in good form, and in a moment more they
were clambering up the gang-steps, and Mollie's
question went unanswered.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Farr," called Dick cheerfully, and thus
addressed, Lieutenant Farr left the wheel and moved
leisurely forward.</p>

<p>"You will have to individualize for yourself, old
fellow, for it would be impossible for me to name all
these charming people."</p>

<p>"Time enough," spoke Farr, in a well-modulated
voice, as he raised his cap and glanced at the group
before him.</p>

<p>"Come, let us get off," he said, turning abruptly
to the men, and soon the <i>Cyclone</i> was sailing lazily
away before a light breeze.</p>

<p>"How delightful!" sighed Eleanor Hill, as she
settled herself comfortably to windward. "This is
my idea of bliss."</p>

<p>Farr paused an instant on his way aft and glanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
interestedly at the girl's earnest face, then proceeded
to his place at the wheel.</p>

<p>"For pity's sake, let somebody go and talk to that
man," said Jean, dropping her voice.</p>

<p>"I fancy he doesn't care much about it," replied
Eleanor quietly.</p>

<p>"You go, Em," Mollie suggested.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" and, nothing daunted, Emily started
up.</p>

<p>"Who doubted her willingness?" laughed Nan
saucily.</p>

<p>Eleanor shook her head at the speaker.</p>

<p>Dick threw himself down in the midst of the group
of girls and kept up an incessant chatter.</p>

<p>One voice was lacking in the general interchange
of nonsense, for to-day Jean Lawrence, who was
usually the merriest of them all, found her interest
flagging strangely. Sitting somewhat apart from the
others, her eyes wandered persistently to where Farr
was courteously and patiently initiating Emily Varian
into the art of steering. There was something about
the man that caught her attention and held it almost
against her will. She noted with what an air of distinction
his rough yachting flannels were worn, and
how beautifully shaped were the long slender hands
which moved so lazily, yet with such a suggestion of
strength. His cap was drawn down over his face, so
that only the lines of a well-molded mouth and chin
were revealed, and Jean found herself waiting with
almost childish interest for a glimpse of the eyes so
tantalizingly hid from view. A sudden shout of boisterous
laughter from Dick brought her sharply to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
herself, and with a keen sense of shame, and a passionate
hope that her defection might have passed
unnoticed, she turned and plunged into the conversation.</p>

<p>"Let us have some songs, girls," suggested Eleanor.
"We are getting very much demoralized, and I don't
know what that strange man will think of us."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I were a little bird how happy I would
be," began Jean, with more energy than correctness.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Jeanie," interrupted Nathalie, catching
up her mandolin, "the other words have lots more
flavor."</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Oh, the first that came a-courting was little Tommy Green,</p>
<p>The finest young man that ever was seen,</p>
<p>But the words of my grandmother ran in my head,</p>
<p>And I would not listen to a word that he said."</p>
</div>

<p>"There, that will do, Nathalie," interposed Helen
with decision.</p>

<p>"Not at all," cried Jean.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Says I to myself there must be some mistake,</p>
<p>What a great fuss these old folks make,</p>
<p>If the boys and the girls had all been so afraid,</p>
<p>Why grandma herself would have been an old maid."</p>
</div>

<p>Jean sang the foolish words recklessly, and when
she had finished shot a half-defiant glance from
under her long lashes in Farr's direction. His eyes
met hers with a long, steady look. Somewhat disconcerted,
Jean flushed hotly and turned hurriedly
away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>"That was a daisy, Jean," and Dick roared with
laughter.</p>

<p>When the merriment had subsided a little:</p>

<p>"Farr," said Dudley, rising and making his way
out of the circle, "I think you have had your turn
at the wheel. Suppose I take your place for a while."</p>

<p>"I hope you are not very much bored, Mr. Farr,"
ventured Jean shyly.</p>

<p>"Quite the reverse&mdash;much entertained," he replied
quietly.</p>

<p>Jean wondered if there were a touch of sarcasm in
this reply, but his face was impenetrable.</p>

<p>"Charming accent he has," smiled Eleanor in an
aside to Nan.</p>

<p>"I wonder where he got it, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Have you lived very much abroad, Mr. Farr?"
queried Eleanor, turning politely to him.</p>

<p>"And why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Why, your accent is so un-American."</p>

<p>A broad smile crossed Dudley's face as he caught
Miss Hill's words. It amused him not a little to hear
reticent Farr thus catechized.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" asked Nathalie, coming to
the front in her usual outspoken fashion.</p>

<p>Farr glanced at her, and then, after an instant's
hesitation, answered languidly.</p>

<p>"From New Jersey."</p>

<p>At this the little group, throwing manners to the
winds, burst into merry laughter.</p>

<p>"Doesn't look a bit like a mosquito," said Nan to
Mollie in an audible whisper.</p>

<p>Poor Mollie looked quite horror-struck, for she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
felt sure that the saucy words had reached Farr's
ear.</p>

<p>If the man felt any annoyance he was most successful
in concealing it, for his expression remained quite
unchanged. Not so with poor Jean, who had flushed
hotly at what she considered Nan's unwarrantable
impertinence. She made a swift, angry little movement,
and the book she had been holding slipped to
the deck. Farr leaned forward, and picked it up.
As he returned it to her his eyes met hers with a quiet,
reassuring smile, for he had been quick to notice the
girl's silent championship, and it had greatly touched
him. The color in Jean's face deepened, and with
sudden shyness she dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>"Have a cigar, Farr?"</p>

<p>To these two Clifford Archer's question came almost
like an interruption, although no word had been
spoken between them.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," taking from his pocket a silver case
of curious design, "but, if no one objects, I will light
a cigarette!"</p>

<p>"I can't help it," cried Nathalie, laughing until the
tears were in her eyes, "did you hear the way he said
that word 'cigarette,'&mdash;with such a lingering over
each syllable? I am sure you are a Spaniard, Mr.
Farr, in spite of New Jersey."</p>

<p>"I knew it," Nan put in, "the moment you
spoke."</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Nathalie, drawing back in mock affright,
"you are an exile."</p>

<p>"How interesting," spoke Nan. "Do tell us all
about it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>"About what?" queried Farr coolly, and Nan subsided,
feeling suddenly very much embarrassed.</p>

<p>Eleanor Hill caught an expression half impatient in
Farr's eyes, and turned warningly to Nathalie.</p>

<p>"You will be sorry."</p>

<p>"When I'm sober," interrupted the young girl
merrily.</p>

<p>"What a rowdy you are, Nat; Helen is looking at
you most disapprovingly."</p>

<p>A shrug of the shoulders was Nathalie's only answer,
and starting up she crossed over, and stood before
Farr, where he sat at Jean's side.</p>

<p>"You have been very good and patient," she assured
him with a mischievous twinkle in her brown
eyes, "and now I am going to reward you by unpacking
the luncheon hamper."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," cried Dick; "I am almost
starved to death."</p>

<p>"What delicious salad," exclaimed Churchill a few
moments later, as they sat about the open hamper.
"Miss Helen, you are a culinary artist."</p>

<p>Helen smiled her thanks.</p>

<p>"May I not sit by you, Eleanor," pleaded Clifford
Archer, dropping down on the deck at her side.
"With you near me I could never know hunger or
thirst."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," frowning on him in seeming disapproval.
"I think your appetite is one which stands you
in good stead."</p>

<p>He was a handsome youth, graceful in the extreme.
It was a constant source of annoyance to Eleanor Hill
that she found him so charming, for, she often assured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
herself, there was nothing to the boy but his good
looks and perfect manners. But who will dare to say
that these are nothing?</p>

<p>"I do hope there are plenty of sandwiches," sighed
Nan, as she sat eating her fourth.</p>

<p>Dick tipped up the plate, depositing a dozen or
more in her lap.</p>

<p>"That enough?" he asked innocently.</p>

<p>"You idiot!" cried Nan.</p>

<p>"Do say something new, Nan," called Mollie from
the other side of the boat. "That is the third time
to-day you have given Dick that appellation."</p>

<p>"How can I help it," groaned Nan, "when it characterizes
him so perfectly?"</p>

<p>"You can't," said Nathalie consolingly, "and if I
were you I would not attempt to."</p>

<p>Dick looked at both girls with withering scorn, then
glanced by them as if their existence were a matter of
small import.</p>

<p>"Helen, can I open the beer and ginger ale now?"</p>

<p>"If it will be any comfort to you, Dick, you have
my consent."</p>

<p>"I think I will try another sandwich, if Miss Birdsall
can spare me one."</p>

<p>"Then catch, Mr. Farr," and Nathalie tossed him
one, with unerring aim.</p>

<p>"O Nathalie," protested Jean, with changing
color.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad to know he is not a muff," said
Nathalie, as Farr caught the sandwich. "What is the
matter, Jean? I didn't know you were so easily
shocked."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"Look out for the boom," called Dudley most opportunely,
and the <i>Cyclone</i> came swiftly about.</p>

<p>"What an unfortunate move. Now the sun is right
in our eyes," and Jean looked up at Farr appealingly.
"Won't you please have it removed?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly. Are not your wishes my law?"
and even as he spoke the sun slipped under a cloud.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful man," Eleanor Hill laughed
softly.</p>

<p>The afternoon sped away all too rapidly, and the
hours were as minutes to the happy young people
skimming the waters of the beautiful sound. Nature
was at her very best this sunshiny summer afternoon.
Light fleecy clouds scudded swiftly across the delicious
blue of the vaulted sky above, and in the distance
the low, far-stretching, Long Island shore was bathed
in a soft, violet haze, broken here and there by
patches of white, glistening sand.</p>

<p>The <i>Cyclone</i>, with every yard of canvas set, was
running gayly before the breeze, which since noon
had grown strong and steady. The swash of the
water against the boat, the slight straining and creaking
of the rigging, the sighing of the wind in the sails,
were sounds sweet as music to the ear of every true
lover of the sea.</p>

<p>And now the summer day began to wane, and in the
western sky the sun was shining with a brilliant radiance.</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed Jean softly, as they dropped anchor
in Hetherford Harbor, "why do all pleasant things
come to an end?"</p>

<p>"But they invariably do," and there was a touch of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
genuine regret in Farr's voice, which was quite sincere;
for in this last pleasant hour, he had thoroughly
enjoyed a delightful <i>tête-à-tête</i> with his pretty companion,
and had every reason, in spite of the merry
chaffing of these gay young strangers, to vote the day
a great success.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
SUNSET-HOUR ON THE CLIFFS.</h2>

<p class="p2">The following morning the girls were collected
together in the upper balcony of the manor,
where the clustering vines afforded a welcome shelter
from the sun's hot rays. A wicker table, laden down
with books and work baskets, occupied a central
position, and the low rockers which surrounded it
were tilted swiftly back and forth as the girls worked
and chatted in an easy, desultory way. On the
wide old-fashioned settle in the background sat
Eleanor Hill and Nan Birdsall; Eleanor lounging
lazily back among the cushions, her hands resting
idly in her lap, Nan all curled up in a heap, her
sketchbook on her knee, her deft fingers making
rapid strokes with a long, well-sharpened pencil.</p>

<p>"Do you know," spoke Eleanor Hill, "I fear we
behaved very badly yesterday. I have had qualms
of conscience ever since, and a growing conviction
that we made perfect fools of ourselves in the eyes
of those two strange men."</p>

<p>"Better that than dullards," laughed Nan lightly.</p>

<p>"Hobson's choice," said Jean dryly.</p>

<p>Just then Helen, with a somewhat preoccupied air,
pushed back her chair and passed into the house, her
mind evidently intent on some domestic question.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Nathalie's eyes followed the retreating figure, until
it was quite lost from view in the shadowy hallway,
and then were bent thoughtfully on her work
again.</p>

<p>"To change the subject, girls," she began, after
a moment, devoting herself energetically to the
threading of her needle, and tossing her head impatiently
at every unsuccessful effort; "have you
heard the news? Helen's friend, Miss Stuart, is
coming down upon us for a visit."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed we have." Emily's sigh came from
the depths of her heart. "I can't imagine what we
will do with another girl here."</p>

<p>"What she will do with us may be more to the
point," and Jean raised her eyebrows expressively.
"I don't know how it is, but I am apprehensive about
this visit. I suppose," with a sort of honest protest
in her voice, "that I have never really liked Miss
Stuart."</p>

<p>"Nor I," agreed Nathalie. "There is something
about her that I do not trust. And the worst of it
is," with a grimace, "that she winds Helen around
her little finger. It always makes me so angry."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Nat. You do Helen an injustice,"
objected Eleanor pleasantly. "However, I frankly
confess to a fear that the harmony of our own little
circle will be somewhat marred by the advent of a
stranger."</p>

<p>"That's so, and then you know she is such a swell
that she will probably look down upon us poor
country girls with the utmost scorn," and Nathalie
gave a vindictive tug at her knotted thread.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course she is devoted to men?" queried Emily
lugubriously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I should judge so, although I have never
seen her with them. You know she has only stopped
with us in the winter season, when we have been
alone."</p>

<p>"Let us do her the justice to suppose that the
men are equally devoted to her," added Jean generously.</p>

<p>"It amounts to about the same thing, whether she
is devoted to men, or they to her," and there was in
Emily's tone such a note of tragic melancholy that
the girls could not refrain from laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a happy nook and cranny of the great
world this dear old Hetherford is," cried Eleanor,
clasping her hands behind her head, and looking out
with dreamy eyes over the sweep of softly undulating
lawn that stretched away toward the manor gates.
"It all seems so idyllic to me. There is so much
petty jealousy and miserable heartburning beyond
the confines of this little haven of rest. People's
motives are so often selfish that one grows strangely
doubting, even of one's friends. Do you know," leaning
forward impulsively and speaking with deeper
earnestness, "I think we girls have found the secret
of true friendship&mdash;mutual trust and respect. These
are what have made our long intercourse such a happy one."</p>

<p>"Indeed you are right, Eleanor, dear," Jean replied
gently.</p>

<p>"The bother of it all will be," interrupted Nathalie
following out her own train of thought "that Mademoiselle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
will come here with trunks full of fine clothes,
and we will be obliged to dress up."</p>

<p>"I would like to see the girl who could make me
discard my shirt and blazer," laughed Nan defiantly.</p>

<p>"How would we look <i>en grande toilette</i> with such
hands as these," said Jean, thrusting forward her own
little brown ones.</p>

<p>"Attractive, but from a different standpoint," Nan
asserted with a fine assumption of authority. "Everything
depends upon your point of view, according to
Henry James. Now, from my artistic pinnacle," tilting
her head to one side, and surveying the group
with critical, but approving eyes, "I declare I prefer
brown hands to white ones."</p>

<p>"By the way," asked Jean, with well-feigned indifference,
"what did you think of the naval officers?"</p>

<p>"To return to our muttons," murmured Nathalie,
with a sidelong glance at her sister.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dudley was very pleasant and agreeable,"
replied Emily, "but I thought Mr. Farr rather uninteresting."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Eleanor demurely, "Nan is right.
Everything does depend upon one's point of view.
Now I thought Mr. Farr decidedly attractive, and
Mr. Dudley just a good-natured boy."</p>

<p>"That reminds me of something I saw in the paper
the other day," Jean observed smilingly. "To the
question 'What is taste?' the answer was given,
'There is no such thing, except on the principle that
some people haven't any.'"</p>

<p>"That is a fine way of disposing of one," and there
was an expression of quiet amusement in Eleanor's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
eyes. "Never mind, dear," leaning forward and
pinching Jean's cheek, "I will forgive you. Besides,"
dropping her voice, "you know that you agree with me."</p>

<p>"Now, what are you girls whispering about?" complained
Nathalie. "Oh, bother this sewing," she went
on irrelevantly; "I have had enough of it for to-day,"
and the bit of work was tossed impatiently into her
basket.</p>

<p>This was the signal for a general uprising, and
then, as they were dispersing, Nathalie made the
announcement:</p>

<p>"Helen has asked Mr. Dudley and Mr. Farr to
dinner to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mollie, turning back from the
open doorway, "and Captain Dodd and his wife, too.
Dick says," with an air of profound conviction, "that
they are delightful."</p>

<p>"That settles it," laughed Nan, "Dick can't be
wrong. Come on, Moll," linking her arm in Mollie's,
"I am going to take you home to luncheon with me
to-day."</p>

<p>It was late that afternoon when Jean, who had been
reading for hours on the quiet veranda, suddenly
jumped to her feet, with a little sigh of weariness, and
tossed her book into a neighboring chair. She was
tired of sitting still so long and felt in the humor for
a walk. Slowly she made her way down the broad
steps and across the grounds of the manor. Strolling
on in a reverie, and heeding but little in which way
her steps were taking her, she came upon the great
iron gates which opened out into the roadway. Passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
through them she wandered listlessly on toward
the water.</p>

<p>It was the loveliest hour of the bright, sunny June
day. Already the shadows were lengthening, and a
little whiff of cooler air was stirring after the warmth
of the noonday. The sun was nearing the western
horizon, now shining out in bright radiance, now
obscured by some light passing cloud. The murmur
of a little brook which followed the roadside, and the
whispering of the wind among the leaves, made a soft
music. Now and then a bird darted by overhead,
singing out a shrill note in some high key, then dropping
into a soft coo. A squirrel ran out from the
thicket, sped across the road, and disappeared over a
low stone wall.</p>

<p>"Oh, you foolish little chap," exclaimed Jean,
half-aloud, as Master Squirrel gave her one glance
from his bright eyes, before dropping out of sight.
"You are the swiftest little fellow I have ever seen."</p>

<p>It was growing rough and heavy underfoot now,
and in a moment more Jean had reached the beach,
and was strolling down toward the cliffs.</p>

<p>The water was alive with boats, their white sails
glimmering in the sunlight, as the dying breeze bore
them slowly on their way.</p>

<p>At the foot of the cliffs Jean paused a moment.
The glory of the golden light fell on her slender,
girlish figure, and illumined her wistful, upturned
face. As her eyes rested lovingly on the beautiful
scene that lay before her a deep sigh of pleasure
escaped her slightly parted lips, for to-day the old
familiar sights and sounds seemed strangely new and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
sweet. A narrow beaten track led temptingly to the
summit of the cliffs whence a magnificent view could
be obtained, and after an instant's hesitation she began
the steep ascent. Turning the corner of a sharp rock,
which reared itself boldly into the air, she came suddenly
to a standstill, uttering a stifled exclamation,
for almost at her feet, stretched at full length in a
sheltered cranny of the rocks, lay Valentine Farr, his
hat drawn down over his forehead, his eyes thoughtfully
intent upon the distant horizon. As Jean's
exclamation reached him, he glanced quickly up and
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Lawrence, this is indeed an unexpected
pleasure. You stole a march on me. I did not hear
your approach at all."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am equally surprised, Mr. Farr, and I
assure you you really startled me. I came upon you,
so suddenly."</p>

<p>Farr's eyes rested admiringly on the soft color in
the girl's face as she went on:</p>

<p>"And may I ask how you hit upon my particular
retreat in these rocks? Let me warn you. You can
only make yourself happy in it with my especial permission."</p>

<p>"I had no idea I was trespassing. Pardon my
curiosity, but by what right do you hold your title to
this spot?" he queried with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"By the right of priority. Do you know of any
better, Mr. Farr?" with a pretty air of defiance.
"When I was a little girl in pinafores I played here
with my doll; when I was a schoolgirl I studied my
lessons in this dear spot; and now that I am a grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
woman," drawing herself up to her full height, and
glancing at him merrily, "I come here to read, to
ponder, and to think."</p>

<p>"A sacred spot indeed," spoke Farr laughingly,
but with just a little lowering of his voice. "I yield
at once, for I see that no one could dispute your
right."</p>

<p>"No one." She threw out her hand with a pretty
gracious gesture. "But won't you let me extend to you
an invitation to occupy it whenever you feel inclined?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, ever so much," he rejoined heartily,
"You are very good. And now, can't I persuade you
to rest a little after your climb, Miss Lawrence?"</p>

<p>She slipped down on the rocks, and he threw himself
at her side.</p>

<p>"What delightful times you all seem to have here,"
he went on. "Do you know I think this is a most
charming place, quite an Elysium." Jean's soft eyes
lighted up with pleasure.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you like it, but I fear you will find
very little to interest you in so sleepy a place."</p>

<p>Farr was about to make answer in words of conventional
flattery, but something in the girl's tone of sincerity
and good faith deterred him and impelled him
to reply in kind.</p>

<p>"But I assure you I am delighted with it. You
know we knock about a good deal, and some of our
stations are almost unendurable. We have been on
the Sound for several months now, and this is to me
by far the pleasantest place in which we have cast
anchor."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>"It does my heart good to hear you say that," she
rejoined naïvely, "for naturally Hetherford is very
dear to us."</p>

<p>"You have lived here all your life, Miss Lawrence?"</p>

<p>"Ever since I was a wee little girl. Of course we
have been away from time to time, but we are always
glad to get back again."</p>

<p>"I can well understand your feeling so, although I
have had very little of home life myself." Farr sighed
as he uttered these last words.</p>

<p>Jean looked at him with gentle sympathy. "You
say that sadly," she said.</p>

<p>"Do I?" He turned on his elbow, and his grave
eyes met hers. His next words were prompted by a
sudden unwonted impulse. "Perhaps I will tell
you about it some day."</p>

<p>Then a silence fell between them.</p>

<p>The sweet stillness held its sway o'er land and sea,
its perfect harmony emphasized by the soft lapping
of the waves against the shadowy sands below. The
breeze was dying with the dying sun. Just off the
shore a little white-sailed cat-boat was drifting in with
the flowing tide.</p>

<p>Jean drew a long breath and started swiftly to her
feet.</p>

<p>"Why, how late it is growing," she exclaimed. "I
must be going, Mr. Farr."</p>

<p>"Already?" he said, and then they made their way
down the rugged cliff.</p>

<p>"Take care, Miss Lawrence," he cried, as she
missed her footing and slipped a little. "Please let
me assist you," and he extended his hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>Jean put her hand in his with a demure uplifting of
her eyebrows, and just a fleeting smile on her lips.
There flashed through her mind the thought:</p>

<p>"How unmercifully Nan would chaff me, if she
could catch a glimpse of me now."</p>

<p>The descent was a brief one, and soon they had
crossed the sands and were strolling along the road
in the direction of the manor.</p>

<p>"You are coming to dine with us to-morrow night,
are you not, Mr. Farr?"</p>

<p>"Your sister was good enough to ask us, and I
shall be only too delighted to avail myself of her kind
invitation."</p>

<p>"I really will not let you come any further with
me," she declared as they reached the manor gates.
"I fear, as it is, I have taken you very much out of
your way, and it must be late."</p>

<p>"It is close upon seven," he told her after looking
at his watch. "And you dine?"</p>

<p>"At seven, and let me warn you now that to be late
is to meet with my sister's ire."</p>

<p>"I shall remember," he answered, with his pleasant
laugh. "And now can I not see you to your door?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I must hurry away," she said as they
shook hands, "for time, tide, and dinner at the manor
wait for no man. Good-by."</p>

<p>"Until to-morrow," he said, as he turned away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />
A DINNER AT THE MANOR.</h2>

<p class="p2">It was the evening of the dinner given in honor of
the naval officers, and even as the old Dutch clock
in the corner of the manor hall struck the hour of
seven, Farr was shaking hands with Mrs. Dennis.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," she said to him with a sweet smile,
"that I shall be obliged to absent myself from the
dinner table to-night, but my strength is not very
great and I dare not overtax it. My niece Helen,"
with a proud accent, which was not lost upon Farr,
"has taken my place for so long that I feel no hesitation
in leaving everything in her hands."</p>

<p>"Oh, Auntie," cried Helen, with shy deprecation,
"Mr. Farr will begin to think me that most tiresome
of all things, a paragon of household virtue."</p>

<p>Farr made a gesture of dissent, and then as Clifford
Archer presented himself, he turned and followed
Helen with admiring eyes. Very fair and womanly
she seemed to him, in her gown of pale lavender
crepe, moving about among her guests, greeting one
and all with gentle courtesy.</p>

<p>His gaze wandered on to where, in a further corner
of the drawing-room, Nathalie was keeping up a merry
chatter with Wendell Churchill. In spite of her
eighteen years, she looked a very child to-night, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
her white mulle gown, with a broad white sash around
her waist, and one red rose in her brown hair. A
spoiled child, too, she undeniably was; unused to
restraint, somewhat willful and quick-tempered, but
with a heart so true and generous that one could
always trust this small maiden and know that the
good would predominate.</p>

<p>Eleanor Hill, standing very erect, her slender figure
clad in a severely simple gown of India silk, her hair
brushed straight from her fair face, her blue eyes
alight with intelligence, her sensitive mouth revealing
every passing shade of feeling, held his attention for
a moment, for there was something patrician in the
girl's mien and bearing which greatly charmed
him.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Farr smiled as he caught sight of
Nan's jolly face beaming with an unending fund of
good humor, and he was man enough of the world
for one glance at dainty Mollie Andrews to suffice to
tell him that she was an adept in the truly feminine
art of dressing, for her white gown, covered with lace
and embroidery, was made in a mysterious Parisian
fashion, not easily imitated.</p>

<p>What an arrant little flirt was dark-eyed Emily
Varian. The smile that Nan had evoked deepened
as Farr noted the rapt expression on Dudley's face as
he bent over her. Her yellow gown, while not as
modish as Eleanor's and Mollie's, nor as artistic as
the Lawrence girls', yet showed a fine sense of color,
and lighted up her pretty, piquant face, which was
surmounted by a smooth coil of hair the color of a
raven's wing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>They were an unusually lovely group of girls, and,
beyond this, unusually pure-hearted and intelligent.
Farr appreciated this the more keenly, perhaps, in
that he had seen much of the world in his thirty years
of life. Sometimes the old ideals of his boyhood had
suffered sadly; but his faith in the gentler sex was
too deep-rooted to be easily dispelled, and now all
that was noblest and most chivalrous in his nature
was awakened by the atmosphere of honesty and
sweetness surrounding him.</p>

<p>He was brought back to the starting-point of his
observations by Helen's voice saying, apologetically:</p>

<p>"I am so sorry my sister is so late," and even as
she spoke a little hand pushed the portières hastily
aside, and Jean stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>She glanced impulsively across at Farr, and caught
a wicked gleam from his eyes as he advanced to meet
her.</p>

<p>"'Time, tide, and dinner at the manor wait for no
man,'" he quoted maliciously.</p>

<p>"That is one advantage in being a woman," she
promptly retorted.</p>

<p>She was radiant to-night in a gown of silver and
blue. From under level brows her eyes shone like
stars, and some slight inward tremor of excitement
flushed her sweet face with unusual color. Her soft
yellow hair was gathered up in a simple coil, little
tendrils of it curling upon her forehead and on her
neck.</p>

<p>"What a bonny little lass she is," thought Farr,
surprised by the sudden feeling of tenderness which
took possession of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>Then dinner was announced, and, with a half cynical
smile at his own susceptibility, he pulled himself
together, and offered her his arm.</p>

<p>"Why, I am quite in the navy, am I not?" she
asked archly, as she took her place between Farr and
Dudley.</p>

<p>"You honor it," Farr returned.</p>

<p>Jean's brows contracted with a slight frown. "That
savors of flattery, Mr. Farr."</p>

<p>"I especially dislike your accusation, Miss Lawrence."</p>

<p>"Then I must be more careful not to run counter to
your prejudices hereafter."</p>

<p>"If you would be so good," he said to her dryly;
then their eyes met, and they both laughed light-heartedly.</p>

<p>"I hope you enjoyed the sail the other day. I
meant to ask you about it yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Thoroughly. Your songs were particularly delightful."</p>

<p>Jean blushed, and answered in some confusion:</p>

<p>"They were very foolish. I really hope you will
forgive our absurd behavior."</p>

<p>"Charming folly needs no apology," Jean found
the glance he gave her a trifle disconcerting.</p>

<p>"But pray, Mr. Farr, do not&mdash;&mdash;" she began, and
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Do not what?" he interrogated, with a faint show
of eagerness.</p>

<p>"Do not allow your soup to grow cold," she finished,
with a merry glance at him from under her long
lashes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"While you are in Hetherford," spoke Nathalie
across the table to Dudley, "you should make a point
of going up to the cemetery. There are some epitaphs
there a hundred years old, and they are so
funny."</p>

<p>"So Andrews was telling us. Speaking of epitaphs
I was very much amused by one I saw in a magazine
the other day. Let me see. How was it?</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Here lies the body of Mary Ann,</p>
<p>With her head on the bosom of Abraham;</p>
<p>Pretty soft thing for Mary Ann,</p>
<p>But very hard lines on Abraham."</p>
</div>

<p>"Here is a good one," cried Dick, when he had
partially recovered from his ebullition of mirth:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Here lies the body of Mary Bin,</p>
<p>Who having had her little fling,</p>
<p>Burst this outer shell of sin,</p>
<p>And hatched herself a cherubim."</p>
</div>

<p>Helen shook her head at Dick in gentle protest.</p>

<p>"What will Captain and Mrs. Dodd think of us."
she said.</p>

<p>"Suppose I should recall one to you all," suggested
the captain, with a merry twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Please do," they cried in chorus.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"He heard the angels calling him,</p>
<p>From that celestial shore,</p>
<p>He flapped his wings and away he went,</p>
<p>To make one angel more."</p>
</div>

<p>"Splendid," exclaimed Nathalie, with enthusiasm.
"Mr. Dudley and Dick are quite in the background."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>"Dick saw his in that charming novel 'Comin' thro'
the Rye.'"</p>

<p>"Guess I did, Nancy. By Jove, girls," he whispered
mischievously, "you are all stunning to-night," and
he drew himself up with an air of pride and satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You shine in a kind of reflected glory; don't you,
Dick?" laughed Nathalie.</p>

<p>After dinner they gathered about the great wood
fire burning cheerily in the drawing-room. The
evening had grown suddenly chill. The wind had
veered to the southeast, and the strong sea breeze
lowered the temperature by many degrees; a not
uncommon occurrence in our American summers.</p>

<p>Helen seated herself at the open piano, and her
music did much to enhance the charm of the hour.
She felt a bit sad to-night and something of her feeling
crept into her music, as she drifted into a plaintive
melody, with an oft-recurring refrain almost like
a spoken regret. As her eyes wandered about the
fire-lit room, with its far-off corners half in mystic
shadow, there were awakened within her memories of
happy childhood days when the love of her father
and mother had been the sunshine of their home.
Interwoven with these thoughts came the recollection
of one who, in those days, had been near at hand and
who was now far away, in strange lands, separated
from her by more than the mere expanse of restless
waters.</p>

<p>She sighed a little and, bringing her music abruptly
to an end, rose and crossed the room. After a few
words of courteous explanation to Mrs. Dodd, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
ran away upstairs to assure herself that the children
were safely in bed.</p>

<p>Just as she was passing through the doorway,
she caught a glimpse of Jean, who, with earnest upturned
face, was talking interestedly with Farr, and
something she saw in her sister's blue eyes made her
start. What was there in that upturned face, in those
eyes, which made Helen feel so strangely, as if something
were going to happen?</p>

<p>And Eleanor Hill chatting gayly with Cliff
Archer found her thoughts traveling in much the
same direction.</p>

<p>In all these summers they had been a very happy
little colony of girls, and they had entered into a sort
of compact in true girl fashion that no lover should
be allowed in their midst, to break the spell. Helen
had been engaged, but that relation had existed previous
to the making of the bond, and she had been so
little absorbed that no one had thought much about
it. One other exception had to be made, for there
was no use in trying to hold Emily strictly to any
such agreement, for flirt she would whenever the opportunity
offered. However, her digressions had
been few and far between, for Cliff Archer and Dick
were almost the only men who came to Hetherford,
and they were so like brothers to her that a sentimental
attitude toward either of them would have seemed
supremely ridiculous.</p>

<p>So this summer had come around as many others
had before, and already a new element had entered
into their midst, and that naughty little Nathalie was
at the root of the matter; for ever since one bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
day in May, when the <i>Sylph</i> had come sailing along
these pleasant waters and Wendell Churchill had
called at the manor to pay his respects, the old order
of things had been changed. Until that day the
<i>Sylph</i> had been better known to Hetherford than
her good-looking owner; for rarely had he cast anchor
in the harbor without having aboard his yacht a party
of gay and fashionable people, who urgently claimed
his whole attention. But now he no longer brought
strangers to Hetherford, and when, as now and then
occurred, he was obliged to absent himself for a few
days, the <i>Sylph</i> lay at the disposal of the girls.
And all this that little minx Nathalie had brought
about, laughing while she disclaimed emphatically any
disloyalty to the vows of their bond.</p>

<p>The worst of it was the mischief was spreading, and
Eleanor's eyes falling just then upon Jean, she experienced
a sense of keen annoyance, for warm-hearted
Jean had been the most whole-souled, the most valiant
of them all. It was a great pity that the <i>Vortex</i>
had been stationed here, and doubly a pity that there
was no immediate prospect of her departure. It
would not do to be introducing all sorts of folly into
their circle.</p>

<p>Eleanor had quite worked herself up to a pitch of
righteous indignation when, on surveying the ground
that had brought her to this point, she became uncomfortably
conscious of some slight changes within herself;
for here before her, looking into her eyes and
saying all sorts of pretty things, which of course were
nonsensical, was the "fatal beauty" whom she had
always looked upon as a boy. Half-vexed, half-amused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
she rose to go, and when Cliff, after helping
her with her coat, gently pressed her hand, she felt
immensely like boxing his ears. It was idiotic and
sentimental, his looking at her in that way, and there
was no occasion whatever for his saying good-night
like a lover in a play.</p>

<p>There was quite a little excitement and bustle of
departure in the hall-way, as coats and cloaks were
sought for, found, and donned. Jean stood by the
large open fireplace, where a log lay smoldering, its
red ashes still giving out a grateful heat, and at her
side was Farr, hat in hand, a light summer overcoat
on his arm. He spoke a few words to her as he took
her hand in parting, and she looked up at him smiling
and defiant. The girl's blue eyes were dark with unwonted
excitement, her cheeks flushed with bright
color, and Eleanor noted all this and found her impressions
of the evening deepened.</p>

<p>When the last guest had gone, Helen dropped down
on the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, how tired I am," she exclaimed. "Do put
out the lamps in the drawing-room, Nat, like a good
girl." Then she rose to her feet with a little sigh
of weariness. "I think I am sleepy too," she
said.</p>

<p>"I wish I were," spoke Jean from before the fire,
her whole expression eminently wide-awake.</p>

<p>"Come to bed, Jeanie," laughed Helen, "and
court sleep. Perhaps it will come to you if you do."</p>

<p>Jean paused a moment by the hall table to select
one from out of the mass of books and magazines collected
there, and then followed Helen up the stairs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>When she had reached her room she threw herself
down in an easy-chair and opened her book.</p>

<p>"You won't mind if I read for a while, will you, Nat?
There is no use of thinking of going to sleep yet."</p>

<p>Nathalie whistled very softly, at which Jean glanced
swiftly up at her.</p>

<p>"Eh, Jean? Love at first sight?"</p>

<p>Jean blushed to the roots of her pretty hair, and
there was an angry light in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be a goose if I were you, Nathalie," she
said scornfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />
A WALK IN THE SHRUBBERY.</h2>

<p class="p2">It was Sunday and Nan and Emily were sitting together
on the vine-covered porch of the parsonage,
trying to while away the long hour between church
time and the midday dinner.</p>

<p>Nan gave a prodigious yawn, and stretched herself
out in the comfortable steamer chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, dearie me," she sighed, "I wonder if it
would be a crime for me to admit how bored I was in
church this morning."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think it would be in very good taste,
considering your father preached," replied Emily
severely.</p>

<p>"I can't help it if he did. I was tired, and moreover,"
crossly, "I am always bored."</p>

<p>Emily raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Nan, your soul longs for Gregorian
chants and tapering candles."</p>

<p>"Of course it does; and acolytes, incense, and
embroidered altar cloths. Yes, I admit it frankly,
I should have belonged to The Church," she ended,
with great emphasis.</p>

<p>"I know, Em," she continued, after waiting a
moment to observe the effect of her last words,
"you will think it absurd; but, I tell you, I really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
envy the Lawrence girls. To think that they attend
that dear, delightful Episcopal chapel, while I&mdash;&mdash;"
and the sentence ended with a laugh. "Why, Em, of
course you won't sympathize with me, but I do think
it is bad form."</p>

<p>Emily looked really shocked.</p>

<p>"Nan Birdsall, I am ashamed of you. What
would uncle think of you?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Nan, with a perverse expression on
her face, "I don't intend that the ministers' sons shall
have it all their own way. I have just as good a
right to live up to the old saying as any of them."</p>

<p>Emily would not stay to listen to another word,
and with a great air of dignity, she arose, and swept
into the house. Very soon the soft tinkling of a bell
told Nan that the noonday meal was ready. Old Mr.
Birdsall stood at one end of the table, his hands
folded on the back of the chair before him, waiting
for Emily and Nan to appear. When they were
come the long grace was spoken slowly and impressively,
and no one watching Nan's demure face would
have guessed at her outbreak of the morning.</p>

<p>They were a somewhat incongruous trio, and what
little conversation there was consisted chiefly of good-natured
banter of Emily by the irrepressible Nan, to
which Mr. Birdsall listened somewhat abstractedly.</p>

<p>The dinner hour had not as yet assumed a position
of importance to either of the girls, and as soon
as possible they pushed back their chairs, and once
more sought the shady porch. Emily gave one furtive
glance over her shoulder to assure herself that
her uncle was not following them, and then picked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
up a novel from a neighboring table, and opened it
with a great show of interest. Nan watched the bit
of deception, and a smile spread itself over her face.</p>

<p>"Puss," she cried, stooping to lift up a little white
kitten which was brushing against her skirt, "it is
now our turn to be shocked and horrified."</p>

<p>Her remark being received in contemptuous silence,
for a while she played languidly with the little
creature in her lap, then her hand dropped at her
side, her head fell back against the cushions, and Nan
was fast asleep. The air was heavy and drowsy, all
about the insects hummed so lazily and the very atmosphere
lulled one into forgetfulness. By and by,
the crunching sound of footsteps on the graveled
path roused Nan to sudden consciousness.</p>

<p>"Oh! dear, Nan," Emily was whispering in a tone
of suppressed excitement, "please wake up. Here
comes Mr. Dudley. I forgot to tell you that I was
going for a walk with him."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Nan interrupted her sleepily.
"I am going in so he won't see me," and lifting herself
lazily from her chair, she slipped into the house
through one of the French windows.</p>

<p>Within the house there reigned the solemn stillness
of the Day of Rest. The door of the study stood
part-way open, and Nan could see her father lying on
his lounge, his white head shining like silver against
the dark leather of the cushion. She stole in on tip-toe
to avoid awakening him, caught up a bright-colored
afghan and threw it over him.</p>

<p>"How sweet he looks," she thought with great
tenderness, as she stooped and gently kissed him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
She paused a moment by the large writing table to
find, amid a litter of papers, an old hymnbook, shabby
from long usage, and opening it marked the hymns
selected for the evening service. Then she passed
out and closed the door softly behind her. She
waited a few moments until she heard Emily and Mr.
Dudley leave the porch, then put on her hat, and
started across the lawn to the manor. Coming out
upon the drive-way she met Helen walking briskly
along.</p>

<p>"Well," she cried, "where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To evening prayers, Nancy. Won't you come
with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I will. I thought you never left the
children Sunday afternoon."</p>

<p>"I don't usually, but to-day I felt just in the humor
for church."</p>

<p>There was a note of sadness in Helen's tone,
which ordinarily Nan would have readily detected,
but to-day the girl was possessed by a sense of personal
dissatisfaction and restlessness, and so, absorbed
in her own mood, this was lost upon her. There was
a pause of brief duration, then Helen drew a long
breath, and resumed more lightly:</p>

<p>"How sweet and sunny it is, isn't it, Nan? I love
these first early days of summer when everything is
so fresh and green. The country doesn't begin to
look so lovely later in the season."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," returned Nan laconically. "I am
such a country girl that I don't half see the beauties
about me. When you are so used to things I don't
think you are apt to be so keenly alive to them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>"I dare say that is true; you see I go away just
enough to appreciate this dear place when I come
back to it."</p>

<p>"While I," grumbled Nan, "have never been away
from Hetherford but two or three times in my whole
life. One year is just like another. There is always
father, deeply interested in church matters, and looking
upon me as an enigma; and cross old Bridget
who runs the house and disapproves of me. I often
long to dance a jig before father and to throw something
at Bridget's head, just to relieve the monotony."</p>

<p>Helen laughed softly as Nan's grievances multiplied,
knowing full well how it diminishes one's annoyances
to be able to give voice to them.</p>

<p>"Then Emily comes," continued Nan, with a
scowl, "and tells me that my clothes are awful and
that I look like a fright, and wonders why I can't cultivate
a slight interest in men. I tell her," laughing
dubiously, "that I would if I found them eager to do
their share."</p>

<p>"You silly child," and Helen squeezed Nan's arm
affectionately. "I won't have you depreciate your
dear self."</p>

<p>But Nan was not to be so easily diverted.</p>

<p>"I do hope that some day I shall see something
of the world," she replied. "I would like to lead
an exciting life, full of incident and adventure,
and oh, dear me, who could lead one less so. I
wish something new and interesting would happen."</p>

<p>"O Nancy," Helen said to her gravely, "don't be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
so anxious to have things happen. It is so much better
when they don't, little girl."</p>

<p>Nan looked up at Helen and felt rebuked for her
egotism, as she saw the shadow clouding her friend's
pale face.</p>

<p>Dissimilar as these two girls were in character, a
very warm friendship existed between them. Helen
dearly loved Nan for her ready wit, easy-going ways,
warm heart, and sunny nature, and Nan simply adored
Helen, looking up to her with the greatest admiration,
and deferring readily to her judgment in all
things. There was a very romantic side to Nan's
nature, hidden away though it was, beneath so much
nonsense and jollity, and Helen's love affair and its
sad ending had touched her keenly. She thoroughly
liked Guy, and he, on his part, had always shown a
preference for her above the other girls. Perhaps he
had guessed at her strong love for Helen and partisanship
for himself, for to her alone had he spoken
of Helen on his return from that last unhappy interview.
His words had been few, but Nan had seen the
real grief in his honest eyes, and her heart had ached
for him. She made a pretty shrewd guess at the real
state of affairs, and she found her firm belief, that
Helen's heart belonged to Guy and that it would all
come out right in the end, greatly strengthened by
her friend's present unhappiness and discontent. To-day
she was full of sympathy for Helen, but she respected
her reticence too deeply to broach the subject,
so she consoled herself with the thought that
this mood scored a point in Guy's favor. Her reverie
was broken in upon by Helen's voice saying gently:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>"I consider it a most fortunate thing, Nan, that I
am carrying you off to church; I am sure the service
will do us both good."</p>

<p>"Well, there's room for improvement in me,"
laughed Nan. "You should have seen Em's face this
morning when I told her that my one ambition was to
imitate the proverbial minister's son."</p>

<p>"Nancy, I am ashamed of you," Helen remonstrated,
with a reluctant smile. "Come, be a good
girl, for we are just at the church door. Let us give
our hearts and minds to the service," she added with
sweet gravity, "and we will see how much peace will
come to us."</p>

<p>"I will, dear," Nan whispered as they started up
the aisle to the Lawrences' pew.</p>

<p>The rector of St. Andrew's leaned somewhat toward
ritualism, and no form nor observance that to his mind
lent beauty and solemnity to the service was omitted.
As the girls took their places the solemn chords of
the Stabat Mater inclined their hearts to reverential
prayer. In a moment more the doors of the vestry
swung open and the organ took up the sweet strains
of the soul-inspiring hymn, "Hark, hark, my soul."
Slowly the choristers filed by; first the cross-bearer,
his young face full of dignity, then the singers, two
by two, and as their numbers swelled their fresh
young voices filled the church.</p>

<p>The grace and beauty of the Episcopal form of
worship appealed to Nan. The rhythmic lines of the
confessional, "We have erred and strayed from Thy
ways like lost sheep," etc., moved her to a heartfelt
penitence for her shortcomings, and inspired her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
with an earnest desire to live more nobly and unselfishly.
One by one her petty trials took their
flight, and only a sense of great peace remained.
When the benediction had been pronounced and the
girls had left the church, they were both somewhat
subdued and silent. The slanting rays of the sun
fell softly athwart the quaint old churchyard, and on
the faintly stirring breeze was borne the sweet perfume
of roses and honeysuckle which grew in such
profusion against the low stone wall. Passing through
the gateway they strolled side by side along the
road.</p>

<p>"I wish I could always attend St. Andrew's," mused
Nan, slipping her hand within Helen's arm. "I
really believe I would be a better girl. The ritual
impresses me so deeply, and seems to bring religion
home to me in such a convincing sort of way."</p>

<p>"I don't think that is at all unnatural; but as time
goes on, Nan, I believe you will find that your love
for outside things will diminish, in proportion as your
dependence upon what is deep and vital grows."</p>

<p>"I would not fret about it in the least if it were not
for my dear father," and Nan's face grew tender as
she spoke, "but I know that this disposition of mine
toward forms and symbols is a source of sorrow to
him. He would have me a strong adherent to the
old school of Presbyterianism, and he feels that my
tendencies are leading me rapidly along the highway
to Rome," and Nan's puzzled eyes met Helen's with
a frank appeal for advice.</p>

<p>Helen was silent for a moment, and then spoke
slowly and meditatively.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, Nan, each person has to decide such a
question for himself, but it seems to me that when
two people love each other dearly yet differ in their
views, each should be willing to make some concessions
and thus grow more generous and lenient with
each other&mdash;Love is such a great power."</p>

<p>"Indeed it is," cried big-hearted Nan, "and I
know that the larger share of yielding should be
mine, for dear father has grown old in his opinions,
and it must be very hard for him to have me branch
out for myself."</p>

<p>They had reached a turn in the road where their
paths diverged, and Nan asked:</p>

<p>"You will come over and sing hymns this evening,
won't you, Helen?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Are they coming over from the
inn?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," and then with a friendly nod each
went on her way.</p>

<p>It was close upon eight o'clock that evening when
Helen and Nathalie started out for the parsonage.
The lovely twilight hour was almost over. High in
the heavens rode the crescent moon, and, as the
slowly fading daylight vanished, its white light penetrated
the soft gloom which lay like a shroud over
the manor park, and trees and lawns and winding
paths came suddenly to life, as by the touch of a
fairy wand. A sighing breeze stirred the leaves,
from a fountain near at hand came the soft splash of
falling waters and the night air vibrated gently with
the myriad sounds of insect life.</p>

<p>There was a rush and a scamper, and around the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
corner of the house the children raced and threw themselves
upon Helen, with a shout of delight.</p>

<p>"You naughty youngsters," chided their sister
gently. "You ought to be in bed this minute, everyone
of you."</p>

<p>"We's going right off," cried Gladys breathlessly.
"On'y we wants to be kissed first."</p>

<p>Helen stooped down to fulfill their clamorous
demand.</p>

<p>"Now, be off," she laughed, straightening herself
up and shaking a mildly reproachful finger at them,
"and don't forget to go in and say good-night to
Auntie," and then she and Nathalie proceeded leisurely
on their way.</p>

<p>They found the vine-covered porch of the parsonage
quite overflowing with people. Wendell Churchill
and Farr stepped hastily forward, and, after an
interchange of cordial greetings, found seats for
them.</p>

<p>"How late you are," called Nan, from somewhere
in the background. "I thought you were not
coming."</p>

<p>Helen left apologies and explanations to Nathalie,
and turned to answer an inquiry from Farr in regard
to Jean.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say she is deep in a book," she said,
looking up at him with a smile, "and we could not
persuade her to leave it. However, she promised to
follow us shortly."</p>

<p>"And does Miss Jean always keep her promises?"
Farr asked lightly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>"I think she does," Helen rejoined, meeting his
eyes for an instant.</p>

<p>"Come, Helen. Start some of the good old
hymns."</p>

<p>At Mollie's suggestion Helen's clear soprano took
up the refrain of "Lead, kindly light," and the
others joined in heartily. From long practice their
voices blended beautifully.</p>

<p>They had been singing for nearly an hour when
Farr rose quietly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Miss Lawrence," he said, bending over her chair,
"don't you think Miss Jean should be brought to a
realizing sense of her delinquencies and coerced into
making some reparation?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do," she assented with a frank laugh,
"but what are we going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I don't think my desertion would be noticed if I
should go in search of her," Farr suggested, lowering
his voice. "Do you?"</p>

<p>Helen gave him a swift glance of amusement.</p>

<p>"'I would not hear thine enemy say so.' But go
and see what your persuasive powers can do."</p>

<p>"You have put me on my mettle now," he rejoined,
as he stepped over the low railing and dropped
noiselessly on to the grass below, and it was with a
sense of amusement that he recognized his own impatience
and eagerness as he set out for the manor.</p>

<p>He paused to light a cigarette, then strode on over
the soft turf, revolving many and varied thoughts in
his mind. The brightness died out of his eyes, and
the lines of the mouth were stern and compressed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
for to-night the past with its perplexities and disappointments
rose vividly before him. In his thirty
years of life fortune had dealt him some severe blows
and had set him adrift with more doubts than beliefs,
more cynicism than sentiment. His was a very reserved
and sensitive temperament, and under the garb
of laziness and indifference his troubles were jealously
hidden from curious eyes. The man's best self lay
dormant, and some influence was sorely needed to
rouse him to the necessity of facing his difficulties
and conquering them before they should conquer
him.</p>

<p>He had left the hedge behind him, and, as he came
out on the drive-way, a gleam of light from the manor
house shot out through the trees and brightened his
path. Involuntarily he started, and a vision of Jean
Lawrence's face came between his mind and all painful
memories and robbed them of their sting.</p>

<p>Reaching the veranda steps, he threw away his
cigarette, mounted them and crossed to where the
outer door stood hospitably open, revealing the wide
hall within, its shadowy recesses softly penetrated by
the light from a quaint lamp swung from the low,
studded ceiling. He lifted the hand knocker, and
let it fall, then pushing his hat back on his head,
stared meditatively before him, while waiting for a
response to his summons. Not a sound broke the
stillness, and at length he took his hat in his hand and
stepped across the threshold, and made his way to the
entrance of the drawing-room, across which the portières
were partly drawn. His footfalls on the soft
rugs scarce heralded his approach. The scene which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
met his eyes was indeed a pretty one, and for a brief
space he stood motionless.</p>

<p>On a low divan in a far corner of the room, Jean
had thrown herself with unconscious grace of pose.
The warm coloring of the Oriental rug and bright-colored
cushions made a charming background for
the slender white-clad figure. A tall lamp shed a
bright light across the open page of her book, on
which her eyes were riveted. Her face was flushed
with interest, her soft hair in fine disorder. Farr
noted everything, from the golden head, resting upon
the silken cushions, to the dainty slippered foot, just
peeping beneath the hem of her gown.</p>

<p>A slight movement on his part discovered him to
Jean, and she started up in dismay.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Farr, you did give me a fright," she
cried, laughing confusedly, for his steady gaze disconcerted
her somewhat. "I should think you would
be ashamed of yourself for having startled me so."</p>

<p>"I am," recovering himself with a slight effort,
for the swift change that had swept over Jean's expressive
face at his unexpected appearance had set
his heart to beating with unwonted emotion. "You
will forgive me, will you not?" he finished, as he
stood at her side and looked penitently down at
her.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, but I don't advise your making a
practice of strolling into people's houses, and appearing
suddenly in their drawing-rooms; you might be
mistaken for a burglar, and I have heard," with a
malicious little laugh, "that it is unpleasant to be
shot."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Miss Jean, you are very unfair to
me; if you only knew the real facts of the case."</p>

<p>But Jean was still a little resentful, for she felt that
she had been taken at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>"Really?" she answered incredulously, with a mischievous
shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes, very," he protested, with a glance of amusement
into her upraised eyes. "I did everything I
could to gain admission in the regulation way, but
was quite unsuccessful."</p>

<p>"What a shame," she said, interrupting him with
softened voice. "I suppose the maids were all out
in the garden for a stroll this fine night, and I was so
absorbed in my book that I didn't hear the knocker."</p>

<p>"And then," he resumed, with a valiant disregard
of the truth, "I came in making as much ado as I
conveniently could, without calling out or overturning
the furniture."</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances I see that you must be
forgiven. Won't you be seated, Mr. Farr? I don't
know what I have been thinking of, to allow you to
remain standing all this while."</p>

<p>"Thank you, no. On the other hand, I want to
persuade you to arise."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I am here on a mission. I have come to
reproach you for not keeping your promise to join us
at the parsonage."</p>

<p>"And to whom am I indebted for this kind and
flattering interest?"</p>

<p>"None other than myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are too good," she cried laughingly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
springing to her feet, and making him a sweeping
obeisance.</p>

<p>"If that is your honest opinion, Miss Jean, suppose
you prove it by going back with me."</p>

<p>"I can't be a traitor to my words," and she tossed
her book on to the table, and preceded him out into
the hall-way.</p>

<p>"Is it cool enough for a wrap?"</p>

<p>Farr surveyed her muslin gown with a critical
eye.</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is."</p>

<p>"All right," she yielded carelessly, "but I never
take cold."</p>

<p>She picked up a coat from the rack, and Farr
helped her on with it, and then they wandered out
into the night.</p>

<p>"Is it not delicious?" Jean sighed, as they
sauntered leisurely along.</p>

<p>"It seems so to me," he returned, with a glance
into the girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"Miss Jean," he began, after a brief silence, "Did
you not tell me once that there was a pretty walk
through the shrubbery?"</p>

<p>"Yes?" with a note of interrogation.</p>

<p>"In which direction would it lead us, if we should
take it now?"</p>

<p>"To the parsonage, eventually, but," hesitatingly,
"by a much longer way than by the path through the
hedge."</p>

<p>"The longer, the better&mdash;for me."</p>

<p>"I don't know what they will think has become of
us," she demurred.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>Farr laughed easily.</p>

<p>"I never trouble myself too much about what
people think."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that you are in no way different
from the rest of your sex. I believe it is generally
conceded that selfishness is its salient characteristic."</p>

<p>"A popular fallacy. Do I not prove it to you,
Miss Jean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course you are the exception that proves
the rule," she returned with gentle sarcasm.</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, midway in the path they
were traversing, and looked straight down at her.
There was a ring of deeper feeling in his voice as he
spoke:</p>

<p>"I want you to think just as well of me as you can,
and I cannot imagine having a more earnest desire
than that I might always prove worthy of your kindest
thoughts."</p>

<p>There was a tinge of defiance in Jean's manner as
she answered him flippantly:</p>

<p>"Don't you think I would be using my time rather
aimlessly, Mr. Farr, were I to give it up to thoughts
of you?"</p>

<p>An expression of keen displeasure crossed Farr's
face.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said stiffly.</p>

<p>Instantly Jean repented of her foolish words, and
was heartily sorry to have wounded her companion,
but the slight tremor at her heart warned her that to
confess would be unwise.</p>

<p>"I think of you quite as much as you deserve," she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
ventured with a nervous little laugh, and she began to
walk on toward the shrubbery at a brisker pace.</p>

<p>Farr made no immediate rejoinder, and when he
spoke again it was in an altered tone.</p>

<p>"There is quite a fragrance to this box-wood, is
there not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and a very pleasant one. The perfume
is heavy these warm nights after the sun has
been shining on it all day."</p>

<p>"You have no idea what a charm the country has
for me. I have really been in it so little since I was
a boy."</p>

<p>"But your home is in the country, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but my family spend the winters in Washington,
and our country home is only open during the
summer months. I don't often get a chance to go
down there. My mother keeps the house pretty well
filled, for my two married brothers live at home."</p>

<p>"And have you no sisters?"</p>

<p>Farr's voice, which had sounded a little cold when
speaking of his home, changed to sudden tenderness.</p>

<p>"Yes, one, and she is the dearest little girl in the
world."</p>

<p>"I suppose you love her dearly, and do your best
to spoil her?"</p>

<p>"Well, Clarisse and I are certainly great chums,"
he assented.</p>

<p>"How nice it must be to have an older brother.
We girls have always regretted so that we did not
have one, although," with a sad little sigh, "we used to
have a dear old friend who was just as good as a
brother; but he has gone away now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose that there are times when they are of
some use," said Farr, "although men are so hopelessly
selfish."</p>

<p>"I would not think of contradicting you," Jean
laughingly averred. "Come, we are talking a great
deal, and not making much headway, and it must be
growing late."</p>

<p>"I am all tangled up in this maze of by-paths. In
which direction is the parsonage from here?"</p>

<p>"If you don't mind climbing a stone wall, we can
turn to our right, and take a short cut, and we will be
there in no time."</p>

<p>Farr agreed, and they walked on in silence until
they had emerged from the shrubbery into a small
clearing, skirted on the further side by a wall, its
line broken at a certain point where some stones
had been thrown down. Farr sprang lightly across,
and turned back to assist Jean. Just then the
moon, which had slipped under a cloud, shone out
again, its soft rays falling directly on the girl's
face. She had one foot already on the first stepping
stone when he put up his hand to stay her.</p>

<p>"Well," she asked, as he did not speak. "What
is it? Are you not going to help me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am, but," leaning a little toward her,
"this wall is a sort of a Rubicon. Once crossed we
cannot go back, for we are then in the parsonage
grounds. It has been a pleasant walk, and one to be
remembered, has it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, with a quick indrawing of
her breath.</p>

<p>"I wish&mdash;&mdash;" he began impetuously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Farr," she interposed with gentle decision,
"will you please help me over."</p>

<p>He gave her his hand, and gravely assisted her to
the ground on the other side.</p>

<p>They were nearing the porch, and already the
sounds of gay voices reached them through the stillness
of the summer night, when Jean turned abruptly
to the man at her side.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Farr, we are to have a visitor
shortly, and I hope you men will help us to make it
pleasant for her."</p>

<p>He uttered some polite commonplace, and Jean
went on:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you know Helen's friend, a Miss Stuart
of New York."</p>

<p>A sudden recollection flashed through Farr's mind.</p>

<p>"Not one chance in a thousand that it should be
the same," he thought, as he answered indifferently,
"I think not."</p>

<p>"I thought possibly you might have met," she said
carelessly. "She seems to know almost everyone."</p>

<p>He half turned to put a question to her, but
already they were at the vine-covered porch, and
Nan's jolly greeting lost him the opportunity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />
NAN REBELS.</h2>

<p class="p2">Into the days that followed were crowded more gay
doings than the quiet village of Hetherford had ever
seen before. Old Dr. Birdsall shook his head disapprovingly
over all this unseemly frivolity, but Aunt
Helen's gentle voice championed the young folks, and
persuaded him to allow Nan to join in the good times.
The naval officers were in constant demand whenever
they were not on duty, and at the end of the week
the other men came out from town, and their advent
was the signal for a series of rides, drives, walks,
tennis matches, and amusements of every description.</p>

<p>Emily pronounced herself perfectly satisfied, and
when Nan and Mollie grumbled over a few of the
changes that had followed in the train of all these
merry-makings, she declared them heretics and disdainfully
turned her back upon them.</p>

<p>It was after a day on the <i>Vortex</i> that Eleanor,
Nan, and Mollie sat together in Eleanor's box of a
room in the inn, and held a council of war.</p>

<p>They had had a beautiful sail. There was a
"smoky sou'wester" blowing, and Uncle Sam's
schooner, decked in holiday attire, had flown before
the wind like a bird. Captain Dodd proved a genial,
pleasant host, and Mrs. Dodd's heart had been quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
won by Helen's notice of her three-year-old boy, a
jolly little chap, whose tow-colored hair showed in
strange contrast to his sunburned face. No stone
had been left unturned to make the day successful,
and as the girls were all good sailors, the stiff breeze
and careening of the boat only added zest to their enjoyment.</p>

<p>However, nothing in this world is quite perfect.
Nan and Mollie scowled at the general tendency to
wander off in pairs. Mollie termed it bad form, while
Nan sniffed, and called it utterly ridiculous. Finally
Nan was roused to action. She called to Jean, who,
with Farr at her side, was leaning against the rail
well up forward, and demanded a recitation. Jean
complied somewhat reluctantly. She stood in the
midst of the little group, one hand holding fast to the
companion-way to steady herself, the other tucked
away down into the pocket of her reefer. She hesitated
a moment, searching about in her mind. Her
choice at length fell upon one, dearly loved by all the
girls, called "Sister Felicité."</p>

<p>The beautiful lines were spoken with the greatest
simplicity, but there was a depth of pathos in the girl's
low voice that went straight to the hearts of her hearers.
The short silence that followed her last words was
more flattering in its import than would have been
the loudest applause. There was a slight pallor in
the girl's face when she had finished, and during the
rest of the afternoon she was very subdued; and Farr,
who had been deeply impressed by her rendering of
this sad and beautiful poem, seemed to share her
mood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>Nan, and Mollie, who were both a little rebellious
at the turn affairs were taking, noticed this incident,
and so the council of war had been called. Nan's
conscience was quite clear, and she plunged bluntly
into the conversation.</p>

<p>"Now that Jean has turned sentimental and emotional,
I think it is high time for us to take matters in
hand. Em always has been a backslider from the
compact, but when Jean begins that sort of thing it
is going a little too far."</p>

<p>"Punning is sadly out of place, Nan, on such a
serious subject," laughed Eleanor, not sorry for an
excuse to interrupt the discussion.</p>

<p>Nan was thoroughly in earnest, and beyond a
chuckle at her own discomfiture, she took no notice
of Eleanor's frivolity.</p>

<p>"I don't think love affairs are much fun, anyway,"
sighed Mollie. "Surely Helen's was miserable, and
only resulted in making everybody unhappy and uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"That strikes me as a trifle pessimistic, Moll," said
Eleanor. "Happy marriages may be rare, but it can't
be denied that they exist."</p>

<p>"Oh! dearie me," groaned Nan, "when you talk
like that you make me feel as if the world were turning
upside down. I never dreamed of it being a
question of love affairs, and marriages."</p>

<p>"I was not referring to anyone in particular,"
Eleanor protested hastily, "we were merely arguing
in an abstract way. Weren't we, Moll?"</p>

<p>"All I meant was," Nan went on in a dolorous
voice, "that we have lost our originality when we begin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
to act just like other girls&mdash;flirting, and all that
sort of rot. We used to have fun in the good old days
when we all staid together. There were never any
discussions as to how we should walk or drive for
everybody was willing to go with everybody else.
<i>Tête-à-têtes</i> were unheard of, and nobody was ever
silly."</p>

<p>Mollie's sentiments chimed in with Nan, but Eleanor's
assent was somewhat slower in coming.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is only a question of time," she
said, "for the <i>Vortex</i> can't be here much longer,
and Mr. Churchill always takes the <i>Sylph</i> back to
town in September. Then we can settle down,
and have a good old-fashioned time during 'the
autumn.'"</p>

<p>"When will Cliff go?" Nan asked, with a sly
laugh.</p>

<p>Eleanor turned her head away to hide the tell-tale
color that rose in her face.</p>

<p>"Oh! come, Nancy, your imagination is running
away with you. Nothing will satisfy you short of the
banishment of the sex."</p>

<p>"Qui s'excuse, s'accuse," quoted Mollie in an
undertone.</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed in spite of herself. She pushed
back her chair, and crossed to the open window.
Along the dusty highroad Cliff came sauntering.
When he was just in front of the inn he looked up,
and caught sight of Eleanor. He raised his hat, and
called out to her to come down, and go for a stroll before
supper. She gave him a curt refusal, and turned
back into the room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>"You shouldn't punish Cliff for my impertinence,"
reproved Nan. "It was not his fault."</p>

<p>Eleanor frowned and spoke impatiently:</p>

<p>"Cliff is only a boy, and a rather foolish one at that.
But to continue. All this nonsense, as you call it,
Nan, will be of brief duration, and my advice is to
make the best of it."</p>

<p>"There is a worse time coming," Mollie declared.
"The <i>Vortex</i> has wrought changes enough, but I
don't suppose we will recognize the old place at all
when the magnificent Miss Stuart arrives."</p>

<p>"Sufficient unto the day," said Nan. "Well, good-by,
girls I must be off."</p>

<p>When the door had closed upon her two friends,
Eleanor went back to the window, and leaning against
the casement, looked abstractedly out. She thought
of Cliff, and the disappointed look his face had worn
when she spoke to him so rudely. Certainly Cliff had
come under the spell that was over them all this eventful
summer. She had striven to deter him, but in
spite of her best efforts, he had found a moment in
which to tell her of his love. To this she had lent
the coldest ear, holding out to him no hope whatever.
Cliff had listened very patiently, but there was something
in his quiet refusal to accept this answer as final
that had made Eleanor, woman of the world as she
was, feel singularly helpless. They had taken up life
again just where they had left it before Cliff spoke,
and since then no reference had been made to the
matter.</p>

<p>The smile had quite died out of Eleanor's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
face. She went over to her writing table and
picked up a little note which Cliff had written her
on some trifling matter. She looked at it for a
moment, then half raised it to her lips. With a
shame-faced laugh she dropped it back among
the letters on her table and turned impatiently
away.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>One sultry morning toward the end of July, as Helen
sat sewing on the upper balcony, a maid came out
through the French window with a small tray in her
hand, on which lay a yellow envelope. Helen leaned
forward and picked up the telegram.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Susie. Is the boy waiting?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss."</p>

<p>"Well, you may go. I will bring the answer down
myself when I have it ready."</p>

<p>When the maid had withdrawn Helen tore open
the envelope. The message read thus: "Can you
come to town for the night? Want to see you.
Please don't disappoint. L. S."</p>

<p>Helen read it through twice.</p>

<p>"Oh I should love to go," she thought. "I wonder
if Auntie or the girls would object."</p>

<p>She folded the telegram and fitted it into the envelope,
and then sat looking absent-mindedly at the address,
the while her face wore a puzzled look. Her
indecision lasted for an instant only, and then she
sprang up and ran through the hall-way to Mrs.
Dennis' room.</p>

<p>Aunt Helen met her request with a ready consent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
and in a moment the little boy was riding off to the
station with Helen's answer carefully stowed away in
the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>As Helen entered her room a glance at the clock
told her that a little celerity would enable her to catch
the twelve forty-five express, and she went to work
with a will to collect her traps. She was in the midst
of packing when a knock came at the door, and Jean,
without waiting for permission, entered. She looked
around the disordered room with a questioning
glance.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>Her sister answered from the depths of her closet:</p>

<p>"I am going to town unexpectedly, and you are just
the girl I want to see, Jeanie, for I have a lot of things
to say to you before I leave."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to stay?"</p>

<p>"With Lillian."</p>

<p>Jean's face fell, and she spoke coldly.</p>

<p>"What train do you take?"</p>

<p>"The twelve forty-five, and I haven't a moment to
spare. It must be noon now."</p>

<p>"It is. The village clock struck as I came in."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Put those things in the valise, Jean,
won't you, while I hunt for my hat and gloves. The
carriage will be at the door in five minutes."</p>

<p>Jean complied, and, as she was making room for the
last few articles in the already crowded valise, Helen
came and stood beside her.</p>

<p>"Dearie," she said, as she drew on her gloves, "will
you please be very attentive to Aunt Helen while I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
away, and not leave her too much alone? And, oh,
Jean, do look after the children. Don't have them
off your mind for a moment. I am always so afraid
that something will happen to them when I am not
here."</p>

<p>Jean laughed cheerily.</p>

<p>"That is nonsense, Helen. Why in the world
should you worry? Of course I will look after them."</p>

<p>"I know you always do, dear; only I wanted to remind
you."</p>

<p>"Well, you need not be anxious. When will you
return?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, I think. You might have the carriage
meet the afternoon express. Now I must fly."</p>

<p>Jean caught up the valise, and carried it downstairs,
while her sister went to say good-by to Mrs.
Dennis.</p>

<p>The carriage was already at the door when Helen
came out on the veranda. She stopped a moment to
kiss the boys and charge them to be good, and caught
Gladys up in her arms.</p>

<p>"Do you want to go to the station with sister?"</p>

<p>"Course I do," enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Helen put the child in the carriage, and then stepped
in beside her.</p>

<p>"Is my valise in, Jean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Good-by, and have a good time."</p>

<p>"I will," replied Helen, as Nathalie took her place
on the front seat and gathered up the reins. "Remember,
Jean, you have the entire responsibility of the
children, and do not let Gladys out of your sight."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>Jean nodded smilingly, and stood on the steps and
watched the carriage until a turn in the road bid it
from view.</p>

<p>Then, as she slowly made her way into the house,
the light died out of her face, and involuntarily she
sighed.</p>

<p>"I wish I did not distrust Lillian Stuart as I do,"
she thought. "It is so unfounded&mdash;as yet."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />
A FLYING MACHINE AND WHAT CAME OF IT.</h2>

<p class="p2">Early that same afternoon Eleanor and Nan
dropped in at the manor and suggested a game of
tennis. The Lawrences acquiesced, and after a search
for balls and rackets they wandered down to the
courts. Jean stopped behind for a moment to find
the children and tell them to follow her, for nurse
had begged a holiday and had gone off for the afternoon.
The sun's hot rays beat down upon the unshaded
courts, discouraging even Nan's enthusiasm;
so, after one set played with flagging energy, they
threw down their rackets and retired to a pretty little
summerhouse, just at the foot of the terrace. By and
by, when they were cool again, Eleanor arose and suggested
that they should stroll down toward the station
to meet Cliff and Dick, who were coming up early.
Jean alone demurred. It was sweet and peaceful
within the shelter of the little summerhouse, and
the prospect of a long hot walk along the dusty road
was not tempting. Most opportunely she remembered
Helen's injunction in regard to the children, and
pleading this excuse she sent the others off with a
half-promise that she might join them at the inn
later, if nurse should get home in good season.</p>

<p>When Jean was alone, she leaned back in her comfortable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
corner with an air of great contentment. She
rested her elbow on the ledge of the seat, and propping
her chin in her hand gazed dreamily, unseeingly
out across the sunlit lawn. The children were playing
under the shade of a widespreading elm, and the
clear treble of their young voices was a pleasant accompaniment
to her happy thoughts. Now and again,
as some look or gesture of Farr's recurred to her with
peculiar distinctness, a shy and tremulous joy dawned
in her face, and lingered there.</p>

<p>Ah, Jean, such moments are indeed golden, when
in your dreams all life seems sweet and fair. Do not
hasten the inevitable awakening, for with the realization
comes ever a sting to make the heart ache and
throb. In after days this peaceful scene will live with
you, the memory of its happiness haunt and mock
you, until you fain would thrust it from you!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Valentine Farr was making his way down
the terraced pathway in search of Jean, his heart
strangely stirred with the thought of the sweet voice
that would speak to him, of the pair of blue eyes that
would welcome him. Then, as he walked blithely on,
there fell on him the shadow of a memory fraught with
pain. He threw back his head and drew a deep
breath, as he squarely faced the difficulties that lay before
him. He knew that before he might dare to hope,
before he might dare to speak to Jean, there was much
that must be told her, and although his heart grew
heavy within him, the look of resolution on his grave
face betokened a strong determination to overcome
all obstacles so far as lay within his power.</p>

<p>He was descending the last terrace when little Gladys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
ran out from her shady playground and, holding out
her arms to him, begged for a ride. He caught her
up and swinging her on to his shoulder held her there
securely as he hastened on toward the summerhouse,
whence he had seen a flutter of Jean's white gown.
Gladys was wild with excitement, and her shrill little
cries of pleasure roused Jean from her reverie. She
shifted her position a little to see what was going on,
and then started up and moved forward to the arched
doorway of the summerhouse and stood waiting for
them. From her elevated position, Gladys waved
frantically to her and then flung her arms tightly
around Farr's neck.</p>

<p>"That is hot work, little one," he declared with a
laugh, as he deposited the child on the ground and
raised his hat to Jean.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was grand!" cried Gladys, capering
around and shaking her golden curls into a tangled
mass.</p>

<p>Jean smiled and extended her hand to Farr, but
her words were for Gladys.</p>

<p>"I have not a doubt of it, darling," she said, "but
I fear Mr. Farr found you a very heavy load to carry
this hot day."</p>

<p>Gladys' head drooped, and she gave Farr a shy
glance from out of the corners of her eyes.</p>

<p>"Was I vewy heavy?" she asked, in such a plaintive
little voice that he had hard work to keep his face
straight as he hastened to reassure her.</p>

<p>"Is not this a sylvan retreat, and are you not glad
you came?" Jean queried, looking over her shoulder
at him as she led the way into the summerhouse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>"Glad!" he echoed. "Glad does not begin to
express it."</p>

<p>"Wait until you see how sleepy and stupid I am
before you make such a rash assertion. Evidently
you are in no way disheartened," she added, as Farr,
looking somewhat incredulous, took his place beside
her on the low seat.</p>

<p>"Not one whit," he replied softly. "It would be a
very novel experience for me to find you stupid."</p>

<p>Jean turned a quizzical glance upon him.</p>

<p>"What an extravagant compliment. Where did
you learn such gallantry?"</p>

<p>"When first I saw you," he returned, and although
he spoke lightly there was an undercurrent of earnestness
in his tone.</p>

<p>Gladys, who had been chasing a butterfly around
and around the summerhouse, now stopped at the
doorway and peeped in. She lingered a moment,
tilting her head, first on one side and then on the
other, and smiling encouragingly on the twain. Then,
as neither Jean nor Farr took any notice of her, she
twisted about and scampered off toward the playground.
Larry and Willie hailed her with delight,
and anyone watching the three little heads so close
together would have known that there was mischief
brewing.</p>

<p>"I know some splendid fun," Willie was saying in
a cautiously lowered voice. "I read lots about it in
a book. It's all about flyin' machines an' human
birds. Let's go over to the orchard, an' I'll tell you
how to play it."</p>

<p>"Me, too, Willie, please," piped Gladys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes. You can come along, 'cause you're just
the person we might want," and Willie's air of importance
was most impressive.</p>

<p>"I guess Jean won't mind," said Larry.</p>

<p>Willie was far too excited to vouchsafe a reply,
and the children scurried along toward the orchard.
Their route lay past the summerhouse, and when they
were opposite it some pin-prick of conscience made
them pause and look within. Jean and Farr were
deeply absorbed in conversation, and it was quite
apparent, even to their childish minds, that their sister
would never notice their absence. Of one accord
they broke into a run, and did not subside into a
more demure pace until the shrubbery hid them from
view.</p>

<p>"You see," said Willie, when he had recovered his
breath, "it is the greatest fun to play birds. All we've
got to do is to use our arms right, an' then we can fly
good enough. It said so in the book," he ended
with a wise little nod of his head.</p>

<p>Gladys' eyes grew big with wonder.</p>

<p>"Can I fly, too?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Course you can. You're just the most principal."</p>

<p>Gladys beamed upon him, and her face wore a
proud smile. To have Willie call her "the most principal"
was a very deep and far-reaching compliment.</p>

<p>Willie heaved a sigh of relief when, after scrambling
over the stone wall, they were at last within the orchard.</p>

<p>"Now, nobody can find us. We've all got to learn
to fly. See, Larry, you just flop your arms so.
They've got to be our wings."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't guess I'se got any wings," sighed Gladys,
"'cause they don't f'y me a bit."</p>

<p>Willie and Larry were racing around the orchard,
swinging their arms in the air until they looked like
animated wind-mills. Gladys trotted after them,
striving to imitate their motions until her little legs
and arms grew very weary. Then she stopped and
stood watching them disconsolately.</p>

<p>"I don't fink you games any fun at all," she exclaimed,
in an aggrieved tone, as the boys ran up to
her puffing and panting from their exertions. "You
don't f'y a bit like birdies, any more nor I do."</p>

<p>Willie eyed her with great scorn.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're only a baby. Course you can't do
anything."</p>

<p>"You said I was most principal," Gladys reminded
him, with quivering lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say," Larry broke in, "I'll tell you what
we'll do, Will. We'll play she's a baby bird, an' then
we'll teach her to fly. We must put her up in a tree,
an' then pretend to shove her out of the nest, just the
way the mamma bird does."</p>

<p>Gladys' face brightened, and she smiled sunnily.</p>

<p>"P'r'aps," objected tender-hearted Willie, "she
might tumble herself an' break her wings."</p>

<p>Larry scouted the idea.</p>

<p>"You're a regular muff, Will. Gladys ain't afraid;
are you, Gladys?"</p>

<p>"Course I aren't," cried Gladys stoutly.</p>

<p>After an exciting and somewhat heated discussion,
the boys finally arrived at a satisfactory decision as to
the best way of getting Gladys up into a tree, and, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the midst of much chaffing and some wrangling, a
rustic bench was drawn to the foot of a gnarled old
apple tree, and the difficult task was begun. "Oh,
dear!" ejaculated Willie, very red and very warm,
"She's a terrible heavy bird."</p>

<p>They were in a perilous position, and Gladys'
burst of laughter nearly brought them all to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Guess I eated too many worms," she said.</p>

<p>When at last she was safely perched on a projecting
branch, Willie clambered down and drew away
the bench, and Larry, sitting astride another branch,
assumed the rôle of master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>"Now, little bird," he said authoritatively, "I ain't
goin' to bring you any more worms to eat, an' you
just got to learn to fly yourself. You must flap your
wings like this, an' when I count three you must fly
away."</p>

<p>Gladys' first attempt to follow these instructions
nearly upset her, but she regained her balance and
gripping tight hold of an overhanging limb turned a
troubled face toward her brother.</p>

<p>"I guess my wings is gwowed w'ong."</p>

<p>"Cause there ain't any feathers on 'em, I s'pose,"
giggled Larry.</p>

<p>This sally proved too much for Gladys, and flinging
back her head she burst into a merry peal of
laughter. In her sudden movement her little hands
lost their hold on the limb, and plunging forward she
fell heavily to the ground. One sharp cry and then
the child lay still and silent, her little white face upturned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Willie, "p'r'aps she's broke her
wings."</p>

<p>Larry slipped quickly down from the tree, and
leaned anxiously over his little sister's prostrate form.</p>

<p>"Get up, Gladys," he pleaded, and then, as the
child did not stir, he began to cry piteously.</p>

<p>For an instant Willie stood irresolute, his hands
tightly clinched, his ruddy face grown pale with fear.</p>

<p>"I'm going to find Jean," he said, and turned and
started on a run toward the shrubbery.</p>

<p>Larry caught hold of him and clung to him in an
agony of fear.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully scared, Willie. Please don't leave
me."</p>

<p>Willie shook him off impatiently, and pointed a reproachful
finger to where Gladys lay in an unnatural
stillness, and then, without another word, he was gone.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>During all this time Jean had not once thought of
the children, and Helen's injunctions had been completely
forgotten. While Farr was waiting an opportunity
to broach the subject that was uppermost in
his mind, Jean herself opened the way for him.
She had been telling him in her happiest vein of
numberless incidents of her childish days; laughing
outright at the memory of many a scrape and frolic,
and speaking with a pathetic quiver in her voice as
she showed him the reverse side of the picture, recalling
those dreary days when to the poor little
orphaned Lawrences, in their desolation, it seemed
that the light of their lives had been forever darkened.</p>

<p>As Farr listened to the innocent recital, told in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Jean's own forceful dramatic way, he found his heart
growing very tender, yet sad withal. It made him
feel infinitely far away from her to hear her speak
thus lovingly and trustfully of her family. Ah, yes,
love was indeed the keynote of life at the manor.
Farr had never realized this more strongly than he
did to-day as he mentally contrasted the happy atmosphere,
the tender relationships of Jean's home life,
with his own unloved, unhappy boyhood. So deep
was he in thought that he did not notice that Jean
had ceased speaking, until she turned and called him
by name.</p>

<p>"Mr. Farr, I have been very egotistical and I want
you to do me a great favor to prove that you have
forgiven me."</p>

<p>"I would find it hard to refuse you."</p>

<p>"Do you remember that day down on the cliffs, so
long ago?"</p>

<p>Farr signified his assent, and she continued:</p>

<p>"Well, that day you said that perhaps sometime
you would tell me something of your life."</p>

<p>Farr's face flushed with gratification, and he would
have spoken but she stopped him almost imperiously.</p>

<p>"I have thought that your 'perhaps' signified a
great deal; that it was put in to save yourself in
case, on further acquaintance with me, you felt that
you did not want to give me your confidence, and I
confess," looking up at him with a reproachful
smile, "that I have been not a little hurt by your
silence."</p>

<p>"Please don't say that, Miss Jean; and do you know
that, strangely enough, I came here to-day to tell you&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
tell you that miserable story, but I scarcely knew
how to begin it."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and then resumed bitterly:</p>

<p>"I never knew half how miserable the story would
sound to you until I listened to you this afternoon, and
realized all that I had missed out of my life."</p>

<p>Jean looked at him sympathetically, and her eyes
urged him to continue, although she did not speak.</p>

<p>"I am going to try not to bore you with any complaints,
Miss Jean, and I must beg you not to be distressed
if I speak plainly in regard to my family, with
whom I am on exceedingly bad terms."</p>

<p>"Surely that does not include Clarisse?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; not Clarisse, bless her heart. She and I
have always stood faithfully by each other. My
troubles began when my father died. I was quite a
little chap at the time, but I loved my poor old governor
dearly. My mother is a woman of great
strength of character and with an unbounded love of
power, and she and I were decidedly antagonistic.
My father, who was the mildest of men, had the
greatest admiration for her and in most things yielded
readily to her stronger will, but where I was concerned
he took a firm stand; so, although I was in great awe
of my mother, I always had a refuge in my father.
My older brothers, Lansing and Fred, never took to
me at all. They were wise in their day and generation,
and even when they were youngsters studied to please,
and so in our quarrels and disputes my mother invariably
took their part. I felt the injustice without being
able to reason about it, and grew daily more surly and
defiant. From the day my father died I had a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
bad time of it, and was always in disgrace. I know I
was by no means blameless, but there was something
in my mother's cold disregard of me that roused a very
demon of defiance in me. Clarisse was the only person
in the world whom I honestly loved, and the first
serious trouble with my mother was on her account,"
and even at this day Farr's face grew black at the remembrance.
"It was a rainy day, and we children
were all playing in the nursery. Clarisse was just
recovering from an illness, and was not yet very
strong. In some way she accidentally broke a new
boat of Fred's. He was angry and, after scolding her
until she began to cry, finally struck her across the
face. I sprang toward him, my blind rage lending me
unusual strength, and beat him unmercifully. Lansing,
nurse, and Clarisse set up a great hue and cry,
and in the midst of it all my mother walked into the
room. Fred, who certainly did present a rather battered
appearance, rushed to her and bawled out a
garbled version of the affair and I slunk off into a
corner, looking thoroughly guilty, I have not a doubt.
My mother did not wait for any explanation, but summarily
sent Clarisse and myself to Coventry. I
might have forgiven her for the injustice to myself.
I was so used to it as to have hardly noticed it, but I
never forgave the unkindness to poor little Clarisse."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, broken at length by Jean.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it, Mr. Farr; surely a mother
must love all her children."</p>

<p>"I suppose my mother did in her way. I do not
tell you this, Miss Jean, to prejudice you against her
nor to exonerate myself, but only to, in a measure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
explain subsequent events. There was never any
sympathy between us. My manner, my character, my
very looks were distasteful to her, and she made no
attempt to conceal this from me. Up to the time of
this occurrence I had had moments of feeling very
contrite, when I had striven to overcome my faults;
but from that time I hardened myself and never tried
to break down the barrier that had been raised.
Clarisse shared my feeling to a great extent, but she was
far too gentle and loving to oppose my mother. She
did her best to soften me and to prevent circumstances
from embittering me. As I grew older my relationship
with my family became more and more strained,
and it was my great ambition to enter the navy and
cut adrift from my home. When finally I broached
the subject to my mother, I learned for the first time
that my father had left his entire estate, which was a
considerable one, to my mother, and that I was entirely
dependent upon her. My mother was exceedingly
generous in those matters, and in justice to her I must
say that, however much she may have denied me her
affection, she always treated me most liberally in a
material way. I had been given every advantage
without stint, and had been brought up in the greatest
comfort and luxury, and without any adequate knowledge
of the value of money. She did not favor the
idea of my entering the navy, but I was troublesome
at home, so she made a concession and I was allowed
to go to Annapolis. In the meantime my brothers had
obediently followed the careers my mother had marked
out for them, and having furthermore married in accordance
with her wishes, she provided each of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
with a most liberal allowance, retaining, however, a
controlling hand in their affairs. Those years at
Annapolis were the happiest I had ever known. I
had been very much touched by my mother's yielding,
and when I was at home I did my best not to annoy
or antagonize her in any way, and we really got along
very smoothly."</p>

<p>Farr had reached a difficult point in his story, and
hesitated a moment to mentally review the past, and
then began again in the same quiet voice that had
characterized his telling of it so far.</p>

<p>"The summer preceding my senior year I went
home to find stopping in the house a distant cousin of
mine, a very nice pretty girl, whom I shortly discovered
my mother had selected to be her third
daughter-in-law. Then I revolted. In the first place
Carrie, poor girl, was quite ignorant of the scheme and
felt no interest whatever in me, and&mdash;&mdash;" He broke
off undecidedly, and looked with thoughtful eyes out
across the level tennis courts. There was one thing
he could not quite make up his mind to recount to
Jean. The memory of it was growing faint (he could
not but smile a little grimly as he thus argued to himself),
and why rake up that disagreeable part of his
past. In truth, how could he tell clear-eyed, pure-hearted
Jean of that other!</p>

<p>"Well?" interrogated Jean, cutting short his
brief reverie.</p>

<p>His indecision was at an end. He straightened himself,
squared his shoulders, and answered with almost
a show of relief.</p>

<p>"Well, the very fact that I was to be compelled to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
marry aroused such a tempest of resentment within
me that I had no room for any other emotion. For
several weeks the atmosphere was thunderous, and
at the end of that time the storm broke. I boldly
announced my determination to remain single. My
mother&mdash;well, she did not spare me. She told me I
had always been a most unnatural and ungrateful son;
that I had deliberately and intentionally thwarted her
in every possible way without once considering the
duty that I owed to her. She gave me to understand
most emphatically that, from the day I finished my
course at Annapolis, she would consider her obligations
to me at an end. That I might go where I pleased, do
what I pleased; but, that her home was no longer
mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, how cruel!" escaped from Jean. Her little
hands were tightly clenched, and her eyes flashed
indignantly.</p>

<p>"It did seem rather hard, especially just at that
time," he returned slowly, some unexpected thought
lending an expression peculiarly somber and grave in
his face. "But since then I have often thought that
I gave my mother a great deal of provocation."</p>

<p>"By not marrying according to her desire?"
asked Jean, a little quickly.</p>

<p>Farr looked straight in her eyes for a moment before
answering dryly:</p>

<p>"That was certainly a great factor; you see Carrie
was an heiress, and owned a lot of property adjoining
ours."</p>

<p>"Oh!" was all Jean said, but the monosyllable
was most expressive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>Farr laughed light-heartedly. He had been
wrought up by this opening of a long-closed chapter
in his life, and it was a relief to have the tension relaxed.</p>

<p>"I have never for one instant regretted it, and certainly
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You haven't finished your story," Jean interrupted
with but scant courtesy, "please go on."</p>

<p>"There is not much more to tell, and I fear, too,
that I am tiring you. No? well I took my mother at
her word, and from that day to this I have never
darkened her door. It came hardest on poor little
Clarisse, I think," he went on sadly; "she had learned
to depend upon me, and when she found that I was
going to desert her she broke down completely. It
wrung my heart to leave her, but it had to be done.
I never like to think of that scene."</p>

<p>"Poor Clarisse!" murmured Jean softly.</p>

<p>"It was uphill work, at first," Farr resumed.
"The lesson of poverty, with its grinding necessities,
was bitter, and its bitterness redoubled by experiences
that shook my faith in humanity." He flung back
his head and drew a deep breath. "Somehow I
lived through that first year, and then it grew easier;
a maiden sister of my father's died and left me a
legacy which, though small, is yet sufficient for all my
needs. It is a good many years ago now, and I have
only seen Clarisse once or twice, when I have
happened to be in Washington in the winter. She is
lonely, poor little girl; but we console each other by
planning the good times we will have in some indefinite
future."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>After a moment, he began speaking again:</p>

<p>"I know how terrible this must seem to you, Miss
Jean. A man at variance with his family is at a great
disadvantage, and after all, you have only heard
my side of the story. I almost dread," gloomily,
"to have you tell me what you think of me now."</p>

<p>"Oh, how unjust you are to me," cried Jean indignantly.
"Do you think that your trouble could make
any difference to me, except to make me sorry&mdash;oh,
so sorry&mdash;for you, and to make me like you and want to
be your friend more than ever."</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly, half frightened by the look
in Farr's eyes. He had grown very pale, and he
spoke huskily.</p>

<p>"You must not be so kind to me; you tempt me
to tell you why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jean! Jean!"</p>

<p>This piercing cry, so fraught with terror, brought
them to their feet. They started forward, and even
as they did so Willie stumbled across the doorway
and leaned up against the post, sobbing piteously.</p>

<p>"Gladys, hurt," he panted, and then, his courage
forsaking him, he burst into a storm of tears.</p>

<p>Every bit of color faded from Jean's face.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? O Willie, where is Gladys?"</p>

<p>Farr put his hand on the boy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come, little man," he said kindly, "don't cry,
but take a long breath. There, that's a brave little
chap. Now tell your sister where Gladys is, and what
has happened."</p>

<p>"We were playing birds in a tree, and Gladys fell,
and she can't get up," faltered Willie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>"Where?" Jean asked sharply.</p>

<p>"In the orchard."</p>

<p>Almost before the words had passed his lips, Jean
pushed by him and was flying toward the orchard.
Farr stopped a moment, to tell Willie to run up to
the house and have them send down a couple of
pillows to the orchard and to dispatch a man on
horseback for the doctor; then he started in pursuit
of Jean. He quickly overtook her, and they sped
across the intervening space in silence. As they
entered the orchard Larry's heartbreaking sobs indicated
the scene of the accident, and in another instant
Jean had fallen on her knees beside her little
sister. The child's face was drawn, and the wide,
distended eyes were strangely, unnaturally bright.</p>

<p>"Gladys, precious, where does it hurt you?" But
a moan was her only answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Farr, what can I do? How do you suppose
she is hurt?"</p>

<p>Farr bent tenderly over little Gladys, and laid his
hand lightly on her arm. A wail of pain escaped
from the child's white lips, and she again lost consciousness.</p>

<p>Everything grew black to Jean and she swayed a
little, leaning against the trunk of the tree for support.
Farr's voice sounded very indistinct and
strange to her.</p>

<p>"Come, Miss Jean, you must not faint. Do you
hear me? Now, take a mouthful of this," holding
out his flask to her.</p>

<p>Jean obeyed him unresistingly, and rallied at once,
the color coming back into her face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>"Gladys has broken her arm," he went on, in a quiet,
even voice that somehow helped to steady her.
"There, that is right. Now you look like yourself
again."</p>

<p>"Never mind me," she returned resolutely,
straightening herself. "Is there nothing we can do
for Gladys?"</p>

<p>"I sent Willie to the house to tell nurse to come
here with pillows and to send Barnes for the doctor.
Now give me the flask and put your arm under her
head and raise it a trifle, so that I can give her some
brandy. There, she is coming to now."</p>

<p>The white lids fluttered, and Gladys' eyes opened
slowly.</p>

<p>"Jeanie, I twied to f'y, but I was too little," she
murmured weakly, and she smiled up at her sister,
who was bending over her with so much tenderness.</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps reached them, and nurse,
a comfortable, motherly-looking woman, bustled up
to them, her arms laden with pillows and restoratives.</p>

<p>Her presence brought great reassurance to Jean.</p>

<p>"Oh, nurse, I am so glad you are here. Gladys
has been hurt."</p>

<p>"My poor baby, Nana will make it all well. She
shouldn't have left you at all. Whatever will Miss
Helen say!"</p>

<p>Jean's face contracted sharply, and she turned
away to hide the tears that sprang to her eyes. Farr
threw an angry glance at nurse, who, all unconscious
of her offense, was petting and comforting
Gladys.</p>

<p>"This is no time for talking," he said. "We must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
get Gladys home as quickly as possible. Miss Jean,
will you help me lift her?"</p>

<p>Jean recognized the kindly intent in his words, and
her eyes were eloquent with gratitude.</p>

<p>"Little one," he went on to Gladys, "will you be a
good, brave little girl and let me carry you? I will
put you on this pillow, and I will be as gentle as possible.
I can't promise that it won't hurt you some,
but when you are once home you will be so comfortable."</p>

<p>"All right," assented Gladys, looking up at him
with touching confidence.</p>

<p>But in spite of all their care, it was a very painful
ordeal, and the poor child was quite spent before the
manor was reached. As they mounted the steps of the
veranda the doctor's gig drove up to the door. They
carried Gladys up to the nursery, and Farr lingered
there long enough to hear his opinion confirmed that
the child had sustained no further injury than the
breaking of her arm.</p>

<p>"I will wait downstairs," he said in an undertone
to Jean, and he went out and closed the door softly
behind him.</p>

<p>The moments dragged slowly, and he had almost
renounced all hope of seeing Jean again, when he
heard her footfall on the stair. She came down toward
him, her white face showing the traces of tears.
He sprang forward to meet her.</p>

<p>"I can't stay but a moment," she said to him, "for
I must go right back to Gladys. The doctor has set
her arm and has given her something to make her
sleep and he is going very soon now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>He laid his hand on her shoulder and looked tenderly
down at her.</p>

<p>"You look worn out. Won't you try and rest a
little?"</p>

<p>She did not resent his action, but she moved a step
away from him and his hand dropped at his side.
Her lips quivered.</p>

<p>"I don't care about myself. I shall never, never
forgive myself for my wicked thoughtlessness. That
poor baby's suffering haunts me."</p>

<p>"I won't have you blame yourself," he declared
vehemently. "I was more at fault than you, for I
claimed your attention with my stupid story."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," she returned gently, but,
nevertheless, her face lost much of its misery.</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment. The past hour
had broken down the last barrier of reserve between
them and had drawn them very close to each other.
Of the two, Farr was perhaps the more conscious of
the subtle change that had been wrought, and he was
filled with unspeakable joy.</p>

<p>"You must go now," Jean told him, "but you will
come back to-morrow, won't you?" She was so sure
of his answer that she did not wait for him to speak.
"I don't know how to thank you for all you have
done for Gladys&mdash;and me," she added very low.</p>

<p>"If I have been the least help to you, Jean, it is
more&mdash;&mdash;" he began, when the outer door was pushed
open, and Nathalie rushed in like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>"What in the world has happened," she cried excitedly.
"Larry says that Gladys is hurt, but he is
too frightened to be clear about it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>Jean hastened to give her an account of the accident,
shrinking back a little from the light that
streamed in from the open doorway, for fear of what
her telltale face might reveal to Nathalie's keen eyes.
Farr bade them good-by and went away, and then
the two girls went directly to the nursery.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER X<br />
MISS STUART'S ARRIVAL.</h2>

<p class="p2">On this selfsame day, after a two hours' trip on
the cars, Helen found herself at length at her
destination. It was somewhat after three when she
stood ringing the front-door bell of a substantial
brown-stone house in a quiet side street. The city
seemed hot indeed after the dewy freshness of the
country, and the sun's rays beat relentlessly upon the
stone flagging and cobblestones. The rumblings of
carriages and wagons rolling by, the tinkling of the
far off car-bells, the constant roar of the great city
fell strangely upon the girl's ears so unaccustomed to
the ceaseless din. Just then a street vender passed
by, his shrill voice crying now and again, "Peaches!
peaches! ten cents a quart!" Helen watched him
pityingly until her attention was attracted by a hand-organ
grinding away, "White wings, they never grow
weary." Two poor little urchins sat on a neighboring
doorstep pitching pennies, their small pale faces making
her heart ache as she wondered what a glimpse
of green fields and winding lanes would be to them.
A feeling of sadness assailed her, as these sights and
sounds, so familiar to city life, awakened within her a
realization that outside of her sheltered life lay so
many full of sorrow and suffering. Her reverie was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
cut short by the appearance of the maid, who immediately
ushered her into the darkened drawing-room.
Between the closed shutters crept a few rays of straggling
sunlight which fell upon the furniture in its
muslin slips, the bronzes and gas jets in their wrappings
of tarlatan.</p>

<p>Helen had hardly found a seat, when someone
hastily descended the stairs, and pushing open the
door, made a rush across the room and threw her arms
about her.</p>

<p>"You dear girl," Miss Stuart cried, "how glad I
am to see you, and how good of you to come. You
cannot imagine how overjoyed I was when I received
your telegram."</p>

<p>"But I wanted to come, Lillian. You do not seem
to take that into consideration." Then, after a pause,
"Ah! how lovely you look, but then it seems to me
you invariably do."</p>

<p>Helen was right, for Miss Stuart, gowned in a dainty
peignoir of white silk covered with filmy lace, looked
especially charming.</p>

<p>At the compliment she laughed softly, and pinched
Helen's cheek. "There is no curing you, is there,
dear? I thought, perhaps, a separation from me might
have improved you."</p>

<p>"But you must not expect it," Helen maintained
naïvely, "unless you grow less pretty."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart kissed her warmly. "Let us talk sense
now," she said reprovingly. "Were you surprised at
my message? I must explain. I was obliged to come
down for mamma on a matter of business, and as it was
too long a trip to return again to Bar Harbor to-day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
I thought it better to rest, and remain overnight in
town."</p>

<p>"And do you go back to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Well, no; not if you will take me to Hetherford
with you."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will, with the greatest pleasure."</p>

<p>"And you are quite sure it is convenient now?
I did not expect to be with you until the middle of
August, but being obliged to come down at this time,
I thought perhaps I had better go to you at once for
my visit. Later I have several others to pay, and do
not know that I could manage then to get to Hetherford
at all."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to have you at once, Lillian; you
could not come too soon to please me, and you can
always be sure of a welcome at the manor."</p>

<p>"Yes, with you, but I am not so sure of those
sisters of yours."</p>

<p>Helen flushed. "Pray don't say that."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear, don't let it trouble you. I rest
quite content in your affection."</p>

<p>But whatever there was in Miss Stuart's words or
tone, a shadow rested on Helen's face for some little
while afterward.</p>

<p>Perhaps Lillian Stuart saw it, for, by and by, she began
to speak again of the manor.</p>

<p>"You have no idea, Helen, how much I long to see
your lovely home, nor with what pleasure I look forward
to being with you, dearest."</p>

<p>"You are good to say so, Lillian, and I will do all
in my power to make you happy."</p>

<p>"You will not have to try, dear, I am sure."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Stuart rose and touched a bell. A quiet
middle-aged woman answered it.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Perkins, Miss Lawrence remains with me
overnight. See that dinner is prepared for us."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss."</p>

<p>"Wait, Perkins. I want you to send Virginie to
me."</p>

<p>In a moment the French maid was knocking on the
door.</p>

<p>"Virginie, preparez la chambre voisine de la
mienne, et portez-y le sac de Mlle. Lawrence."</p>

<p>When the girls at length were seated in Miss
Stuart's pretty boudoir, they fell into a long and
pleasant chat, finding much to say to one another
after several months' separation.</p>

<p>By and by Miss Stuart presented a programme for
the evening, saying. "Now, Helen, you little puritan,
don't dare to find fault or criticise. My cousin,
Harry Stuart, is going to take us to the theater, and it
will be perfectly charming. He is almost like a
brother to me, and there could not be the slightest
impropriety in it."</p>

<p>Helen did not demur then, but, after returning from
the theater and in looking back over the evening, she
felt some misgivings. "Harry" proved to be a gay,
scatterbrained youth, more or less in love with his
beautiful cousin. He stared a little curiously at
Helen on being presented, and then devoted himself
exclusively to Miss Stuart, whom he treated with a
lack of deference, a familiarity, which Helen hotly resented.
Miss Stuart, however, was apparently quite
oblivious of it, and flirted with him openly, exchanging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
glances of amusement with him, as Helen's face
grew graver and graver.</p>

<p>A chance remark of his, which unfortunately
reached Helen's ears, did not tend to soften her
judgment of him.</p>

<p>"Who is your little friend, coz? She is tremendously
respectable, and doesn't approve of us at
all."</p>

<p>Helen retired to her room that night in a frame of
mind to find serious fault with her fascinating
friend.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart realized that she had gone a little too
far, and determined to overcome the impression she
had made. She well knew the power that her great
beauty exerted over Helen, blinding her to faults that
he who ran might read, so she coiled her mass of
auburn hair most becomingly, slipped on a dainty pale
blue wrapper, encased her feet in slippers of the same
hue and presented herself in Helen's room, and proceeded
to make herself so charming and agreeable
that in ten minutes Helen had completely forgotten
her grievance.</p>

<p>The following morning, at an early hour, they left
for Hetherford. Helen neglected to wire Jean of
their change of plan, so no carriage met them at the
station, and they were obliged to rumble up to the
manor in the old Hetherford stage.</p>

<p>Helen's heart sank when Jean ran down to the
veranda to tell her of Gladys' accident.</p>

<p>"You cannot imagine how I felt, Helen, for I knew
it was all my fault. I should not have forgotten her
for one moment."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed, I think you were very careless, Jean."
Helen spoke sharply, for her anxiety made her nervous
and irritable.</p>

<p>Jean had gone forward and shaken hands with Miss
Stuart, but at these words she turned abruptly away.
She felt so reproached and woe-begone. It almost
seemed to her that all the world must know how
completely absorbed she had been in that sweet
talk with Farr, to have allowed her mind to wander
from the little sister. In this guilty and depressed
state of mind, her welcome to Miss Stuart
somewhat lacked cordiality, and the latter, who had
never liked Jean, found herself no whit better
pleased.</p>

<p>Nathalie came flying down the stairs, making a fortunate
diversion.</p>

<p>"Now, Helen, don't scold Jean, for she is heartbroken.
Gladys is doing splendidly and will be about
in a few days. How do you do, Miss Stuart? I am
very glad to see you, and so sorry that our anxiety
about Gladys is making us forget to make you at
home. Please let me take your bag, and come right
up to your old quarters."</p>

<p>Helen looked gratefully at her sister, and Miss
Stuart's manner relaxed under this warm cordiality,
and she followed Nathalie up to her room.</p>

<p>Jean went out upon the veranda, and walked slowly
up and down. Her thoughts, which for a moment
had been diverted, flew swiftly back to Farr. He had
not spoken the words, yet she knew he loved her.
She trembled a little, startled at the depth of emotion
this knowledge aroused in her. So this was love&mdash;this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
sudden wild beating of her heart, this passionate
joy of living.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," she thought, with yearning tenderness,
"how much he has suffered."</p>

<p>It was a blessed comfort to feel that it lay within
her power to help to brighten his lonely, loveless life.
She stood quite still and clasped her hands tightly
together. "I love him! I love him!" The unspoken
words sent the blood to her cheeks, and she
was filled with dismay. She roused herself abruptly
from her dream and hastened upstairs to join Helen
in the nursery.</p>

<p>That day seemed interminable to Jean. When the
long afternoon had worn away and Farr had not
come, she consoled herself with the thought that the
evening would surely bring him. She tried to curb
her impatience by filling the slow-footed moments
with manifold unnecessary duties, but it seemed to
her that the happy time would never come.</p>

<p>They were all very quiet at dinner, for Helen was
listening for the slightest sound from the nursery,
while Jean's absorbing thoughts held her tongue in
chains.</p>

<p>"Well, well," cried Nathalie at last, "what will
Miss Stuart think of us? No doubt that this is the
home of the Sphinx. Our silence is growing gruesome."</p>

<p>Thus recalled to her duties as hostess, Helen
glanced quickly at her friend, and was distressed to
see the expression of cold disdain that rested on her
face.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Lillian," she said penitently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
leaning forward and taking Miss Stuart's hand. "I
am so upset about Gladys that I have forgotten my
manners."</p>

<p>"Pray, don't apologize, Helen. It is of no consequence
whatever." Miss Stuart spoke with studied
indifference and withdrew her hand. She deemed
it only her right to be first with her friends always
and under all circumstances; and to have Helen,
adoring, subservient Helen, relegate her to a position
of secondary importance was an offense which merited
instant punishment.</p>

<p>Jean and Nathalie, on the alert for any slight to
their sister, exchanged significant glances.</p>

<p>Helen made no further demonstration of affection,
but began to talk gently and courteously to her
guest. Jean and Nathalie came valiantly to her
assistance, until at last Miss Stuart was forced to
respond to their friendly overtures. When they
were leaving the dining room she slipped her hand
into Helen's arm. It was the nearest approach to an
apology of which her nature was capable, and Helen
had fain to be content. All her life Miss Stuart had
been in the habit of snubbing people at her own sweet
will and had found it a diverting occupation; but
somehow it hurt her to snub Helen, the girl was
always so patient and generous about it.</p>

<p>They drifted quite naturally out onto the veranda.
The sky was overcast, and a faint wind sighed among
the trees. The heavy clouds promised rain, and the
earth, after reveling in days of sunshine and nights
of brilliant beauty, seemed wrapped in melancholy
submission.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Before very long Nan and Emily came running
across the lawn. Nan greeted Miss Stuart cordially,
but Emily was very cool, and looked askance at this
dangerously beautiful addition to their circle. When
she had shaken hands, she faced the girls as solemn
as a judge.</p>

<p>"Girls, what do you suppose has happened? The
<i>Vortex</i> has gone away, and those miserable men
never came to say good-by, and did not even send a
line."</p>

<p>"Now see here, Emily," Nan interposed warmly.
"I don't believe in being unjust. It must have been
a sudden move, and of course we will hear from
them."</p>

<p>"It is a great shame," complained Nathalie. "What
shall we do with ourselves?"</p>

<p>At Emily's first words Jean started forward, then
fell back in her chair, dazed and stunned. She
pressed her hand against her heart to stay its loud
throbbing, passionately grateful that the kindly darkness
sheltered her from view. She could not tell how
long it might have been when she was aroused by a
sentence from Emily which arrested her attention.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is such a pretty stitch. I'll teach it to you
some day, Helen."</p>

<p>Had she heard aright? Could it be possible that
the <i>Vortex</i> was already forgotten&mdash;its officers banished
to the indifferent past? Her sudden excitement
died away and a dull feeling of pain tugged at
her heart. Her hands dropped nervelessly into her
lap, and her lids closed wearily over her aching eyes.</p>

<p>The conversation drifted into local channels, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Miss Stuart was beginning to feel very much bored
when Eleanor and Cliff sauntered up the driveway
and joined the party. She awaked from her apathy
to survey Cliff critically, and then proceeded to monopolize
his attention. Cliff dropped into a chair beside
her and lent himself readily to her plan. She
was a charming woman, a beautiful woman, so he
assumed his most devoted manner, and apparently
succumbed at once to her gracious, subtle flattery.
Eleanor cast an amused glance at him over her
shoulder; she felt too sure of him to be disturbed;
and pushing her way among the group until she
reached Jean's side:</p>

<p>"I met Johnnie Matthews at the gate, dear. He
was on his way to the manor with a note for you, and,
since it required no answer, I volunteered to bring it
up."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Eleanor. I suppose Mrs. Matthews wants
me to take her class again next Sunday. She has
been ill."</p>

<p>Eleanor had dropped the note into Jean's lap and
was moving away, but something in her friend's voice
startled her. She looked at her curiously, but in that
light she could not discern her expression. She hesitated
a moment, and then sat down on the arm of
Jean's chair.</p>

<p>"How is Gladys to-night?" she asked.</p>

<p>Jean made an effort to speak more naturally.</p>

<p>"Very comfortable, thank you. The doctor says her
arm is doing nicely, and so far she has not had any
fever."</p>

<p>"Eleanor, did you know the <i>Vortex</i> had gone?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>As Nathalie spoke Eleanor impulsively took Jean's
hand in hers. It was very cold, and trembled in her
clasp. Jean's unhappiness was explained, and at the
same moment another idea flashed through her mind.
She answered Nathalie with well-feigned lightness:</p>

<p>"It can't be more than a temporary absence, I am
sure." Then added in a lower tone to Jean, "Don't
you want to read your note, dearie? It may not be
from Mrs. Matthews."</p>

<p>Jean gave a start, and, instinctively, her disengaged
hand closed over the note in her lap.</p>

<p>"I think I will take it to the light."</p>

<p>She rose hurriedly and made her way to the doorway,
where the light from the lamp fell upon her
letter. The handwriting was unfamiliar, and Jean's
heart seemed to stand still as she tore open the envelope.
The opening words dispelled the last doubt;
her whole expression changed, and she eagerly drank
in the contents of the sheet, all unconscious of the
pair of eyes that were watching her narrowly.
Nothing escaped Miss Stuart. She saw plainly the
sudden start, the rising color, the tremulous happiness
in the young girl's face. Perhaps the sight stirred
some strange memory, deep hidden in her heart, for
she smiled bitterly, and answered some pleasantry of
Cliff's with such stinging cynicism that even that languid
youth was aroused to retort.</p>

<p>But to Jean the whole world was forgotten, as she
read the lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Lawrence:</span></p>

<p>It is with deep regret I write you that the <i>Vortex</i> has been
ordered up the Sound to survey a certain locality. Most unfortunately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
our orders came very late. We have only just time to
catch the tide by weighing anchor at once. I do not know whether
you realize how great is my disappointment at leaving Hetherford,
or how great is my regret at not seeing you before I go.
Our stay, I trust, will not extend beyond a week, and I look forward
with great pleasure to the time when we once more cast anchor
in your harbor. I shall be anxious for news of little Gladys,
and if I did not fear to presume, I should ask you to write me.
Perhaps your goodness of heart will prompt you to forgive and
indulge me at the same time. My address will be F&mdash;&mdash;, which
is the post-office nearest to our anchorage.</p>

<p class="left45">
Yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap i7">Valentine Farr.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Jean raised her eyes and let them rest on the group
of people outside the doorway. No one, apparently,
had a thought for her; for Miss Stuart had discreetly
withdrawn her gaze, and they one and all seemed
absorbed in the merry conversation. She longed to
slip away to her own room, that she might be
alone with her happy thoughts, but paused, irresolute,
wondering, as she crumpled the note in
her hand, if it would be unpardonably rude to leave
her guests thus abruptly. Helen came to her rescue.</p>

<p>"Jean, will you please go up and see if Gladys is
asleep?"</p>

<p>Jean nodded her head in assent, and gladly disappeared.
Eleanor looked after her with a kindly smile,
yet she sighed a little, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"What would Nan do if she knew this?" she
thought.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward a servant came to the door, bringing
word that Miss Gladys was sleeping soundly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
that Miss Jean begged to be excused, as she had a
headache.</p>

<p>In the night the rain fell heavily, and the rising
wind sighed and sobbed like a child in pain, but Jean's
dreams were sweet, and her last sleeping and first
waking thoughts were of Valentine Farr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XI.<br /><br />
DULL DAYS.</h2>

<p class="p2">The days that followed were the quietest that this
summer had brought to Hetherford. Not only
had the <i>Vortex</i> gone, but Wendell and Churchill had
carried the other men off on the <i>Sylph</i> for a long-planned
fishing excursion, and the girls were left to
their own devices. This was too common an occurrence
to be looked upon as a great hardship; yet it was
quite obvious, even to Nan, that they did not revel so
much in their once treasured independence, and that
the old-time simple pleasures had somehow lost their
zest. There was something strangely amiss in the
little colony. Jean, who had always been depended
upon to set the ball rolling, and to keep everyone in
good spirits, failed them utterly. She was so quiet
and absent-minded, so unlike her usual self, that
Eleanor began to fear that her surmises in regard to
the letter had been incorrect after all. Miss Stuart's
presence at the manor acted as a great restraint upon
everybody. She did not adapt herself in the least to
their quiet, humdrum existence, and maintained a
stoical silence that was especially irritating. The
weather was very depressing. A fine drizzling rain fell
persistently, the sky was gray and leaden, and the roads
and lanes were almost impassable with the mud. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
dampness retarded Gladys' recovery, and she was
fractious and troublesome. Poor Helen was in despair,
for Miss Stuart was unreasonable enough to
resent her spending so much time in the nursery, and
took small pains to conceal the fact that she was almost
bored to death.</p>

<p>By Friday Aunt Helen was seriously fretting over
her niece, for Helen was looking pale and tired and
seemed quite incapable of coping with the anxieties
of housekeeping, Gladys, and the entertainment of
her difficult friend.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of this day the rain ceased and
Nathalie, in despair of any more interesting amusement,
declared her intention to drive to the station to
see the express arrive.</p>

<p>"Not that anyone ever comes here," she said
dolorously as she drew on her driving gloves.</p>

<p>An hour later she burst into the drawing-room, her
face radiant, her eyes twinkling. Helen sat before
the low tea-table serving tea, Miss Stuart lounged in
a huge armchair, while Jean was on her way between
the tea-table and Miss Stuart, with a dainty cup in
her hand. She paused, and looked expectantly at
Nathalie.</p>

<p>"Well, cheer up, girls, for I have some news at
last. Who do you think arrived to-day?"</p>

<p>Even Miss Stuart leaned forward in her chair, and
lost something of her air of languor.</p>

<p>"Don't ask tiresome riddles, Nathalie," pleaded
Jean, "but tell us."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Archer."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart looked blank; Helen laughed softly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
and Jean handed Miss Stuart her cup of tea with a
disgusted expression on her bonny face.</p>

<p>"You must, indeed, be in the depths to call that
good news," she said scornfully.</p>

<p>"I didn't say good news. I said news," Nathalie
retorted triumphantly, "and in any case I think Mrs.
Archer is a godsend after the monotony of the last
few days."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart smiled faintly for Nathalie, but echoed
her sentiments.</p>

<p>"I think Cliff's mother is a charming woman,"
interposed Helen. "She is somewhat overbearing
and imposing, but I know she does not mean to be
disagreeable."</p>

<p>"I like her," maintained Nathalie. "She is so
worldly, so thoroughly magnificent."</p>

<p>Jean laughed and meekly took her cup of tea from
Helen.</p>

<p>"I have not another word to say. I suppose the
truth is that I am mortally afraid of Mrs. Archer.
She completely subdues me."</p>

<p>After a moment she spoke again, from the comfortable
place she had taken on the divan:</p>

<p>"Do you know, Nathalie, just for one moment I
thought it might have been Guy of whom you were
speaking."</p>

<p>Helen set the teapot down suddenly, and there was
a moment's uncomfortable silence. Miss Stuart let
her glance travel slowly from Helen's flushed face to
Jean's grave one.</p>

<p>"Are you speaking of Mr. Appleton?" she asked
lazily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jean, with perfect unconsciousness,
"I suppose you met him at the same time you did
Helen. I wish it had been he instead of Mrs.
Archer."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart shrugged her shoulders, and answered
with insolent disregard of Jean's evident affection
for Guy:</p>

<p>"A nice enough man in his way, but so deadly uninteresting,
so lacking in that knowledge of the world
which alone makes a man worth talking to."</p>

<p>Jean's eyes flashed, and her voice trembled with
anger.</p>

<p>"Mr. Appleton is a very dear friend of ours, Miss
Stuart, and to none of us is it agreeable to hear him
spoken ill of."</p>

<p>She looked impulsively across at Helen, feeling sure
that her sister would speak some word of vindication
of Guy, but the girl's head was bent and she seemed
wholly occupied in pushing the tea-cups aimlessly
about on the polished surface of the mahogany tea-table.
For the first time in her life Jean felt a contempt
for her sister, and pressed her lips tightly
together to keep down the bitter words that rose to
them. Nathalie, who hated a scene above all things,
and yet was too thoroughly in sympathy with Jean to
feel equal to changing the conversation, sat down at
the piano and began to drum.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart looked from one to the other and
laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Appleton should be proud of such an ardent
champion."</p>

<p>Jean made no answer. She finished her tea in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
silence and then left the room, followed by a sneering
glance from Miss Stuart's eyes.</p>

<p>That evening Mrs. Andrews and her sister, Mrs.
Archer, called at the manor. The young people had
taken advantage of the first clear evening since Miss
Stuart's arrival and had gone for a walk, so Mrs.
Dennis asked her guests up to her room. During the
conversation Mrs. Andrews said:</p>

<p>"How badly Helen is looking lately."</p>

<p>Aunt Helen agreed with her and related to Mrs.
Archer the facts of Gladys' accident, and dilated upon
Helen's untiring devotion to her little sister.</p>

<p>"She is worn out," she sighed in conclusion, "and
it is so hard for her to have Miss Stuart here just at
present."</p>

<p>"You don't mean Lillian Stuart, that beautiful girl
about whom everyone is raving?" exclaimed Mrs.
Archer, roused to a degree of interest she rarely felt
when in Hetherford.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is the same. She is certainly very
beautiful, but somehow," and Aunt Helen's face grew
puzzled, "she doesn't seem at all the kind of girl my
Helen should care for. However, they are close
friends, so I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is a great belle," Mrs. Archer interrupted
brusquely. "Poor girl! What in the world does she
do with herself in this out-of-the-way place?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Andrews replied with some heat:</p>

<p>"She must be very hard to please if she cannot find
anything to amuse or interest her here."</p>

<p>A gleam of amusement flashed into Aunt Helen's
eyes, but was instantly suppressed. Hetherford was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
the basis of an old feud between the sisters, and had
been the cause of more than one bitter quarrel.
Mrs. Archer was a fashionable woman to the tips of
her fingers, and for years she had striven to impress
her easy-going sister with the importance of society,
and to persuade her at least to spend her summers in
some resort more frequented by the world of society.
Mrs. Andrews, however, stood out against her and
stoutly maintained that she and her children were perfectly
happy where they were, and Mrs. Archer had to
content herself with an occasional visit from her niece
Mollie, who was eminently unsatisfactory as a fashionable
girl. To crown her displeasure, her only son
Clifford, instead of finding pleasure in his charming
home at Newport, insisted upon spending the summer
at Hetherford Inn, and Mrs. Archer bore a great
grudge against this small place. She was a very
hospitable woman, and enjoyed keeping open house,
but she found it a great drawback to have no young
person at home.</p>

<p>As she rose to leave, it suddenly occurred to her
that it would be very delightful to take two of the
girls back to Newport with her. Her choice fell upon
Helen, because in that way she could include Miss
Stuart in the invitation. Mrs. Dennis met the suggestion
with approval, for she knew it would do
Helen good to get away from home for a few days,
and that so pleasant a change would please Miss
Stuart. In the midst of the discussion, the two girls
walked into the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Archer's shrewd, worldly eyes took in every
detail of Miss Stuart's beautiful face and faultless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
gown, and she instantly dropped the somewhat patronizing
tone she had used toward Helen, and urged
their acceptance with great cordiality. Helen hesitated,
for she was loath to leave Gladys again, but
Aunt Helen and Miss Stuart overruled all her objections,
and it was agreed that they should accompany
Mrs. Archer.</p>

<p>The quiet that settled down over the manor after
their departure was very grateful to Jean, who during
the past week had been disturbed and harassed.
She knew that she was fast approaching the most
serious crisis of her life. All during these joyous
summer days she had drifted on so happily, evading
self-questionings, living only for the day. Now she
realized that the drifting was at an end. On his return
Valentine Farr would speak to her, and although
she had no doubt as to the answer she would give him,
yet she trembled a little and would fain have been
alone with her secret. And now, when she would
have had her whole mind dominated by this one
thought, Miss Stuart's unwelcome presence in the house
thrust other and less pleasant thoughts upon her. Up
to the time of this last visit Jean's dislike of Miss Stuart
had been a vague, passing sentiment, which had concerned
her but little. She had distrusted her always,
but even that distrust was purely intuitive, for she had
no idea of the part Miss Stuart had played in the
severing of Helen's engagement. In that slight controversy
about Guy, however, Jean had unwittingly
pierced beneath the surface of Miss Stuart's suave
manner, and had caught a glimpse of the girl's true
nature. She could not understand why this should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
affect her so strongly. In vain she tried to account
for it to herself. Miss Stuart, although so dear a
friend of Helen's, occupied a comparatively unimportant
position in their home life. In another fortnight
she would be gone from among them, and for
months they would know nothing of her, save what
Helen might choose to communicate from her oft received
letters. So Jean argued with herself, battling
with a curious sense of apprehension that struggled
within her. She longed to talk it all over with Aunt
Helen, whose judgment was always to be trusted; but
that seemed a kind of disloyalty to Helen, so she
smothered the vague doubts and fears which threatened
to overwhelm her usual good sense. Her
thoughts flew off to Farr, and poised over that
strange talk they had had on that last afternoon.
She drew from her pocket a letter that had
come from him, and read it over slowly, lingering
over every sentence. But when she had finished and
was folding it into its envelope again, she sighed a
little, for even that dear missive could not quite dispel
the vision which haunted her of Lillian Stuart's
beautiful, cruel face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XII.<br /><br />
EDDYING CURRENTS.</h2>

<p class="p2">Monday dawned bright and clear. When Jean
awoke the sunlight was flooding the room, and
through the open window came the sweet voices of the
birds as they merrily chirped and sang. As she sprang
out of bed she was filled with a sense of well-being
and happiness. She could even find it in her heart
to laugh a little scornfully at the fancies that had disturbed
her, for they had vanished with the vanishing
clouds. She dressed hurriedly and ran down to the
dining room with a snatch of song upon her lips. By
her plate on the breakfast table lay an envelope addressed
in a man's legible handwriting. She flushed
as she caught it up, and crossed to the window to read
it. Farr had written in great haste to say that the
<i>Vortex</i> would be in Hetherford Harbor by noon on
Monday. When Jean had reached that point in his
note she read no further. She stood very still, her
hands holding the bit of paper closely, her breath
coming hurriedly through her slightly parted lips.
For one moment thus&mdash;then the maid entered bearing
the coffee urn, Larry clattered noisily into the room,
and Jean turned back to the ordinary duties of everyday
life. But her face was still illumined, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
depths of her shining eyes lingered the reflection of
her soul's great happiness.</p>

<p>During the morning a telegram came from Helen
saying that she and Miss Stuart would arrive by the
afternoon express. Jean had just terminated a long
interview with the cook, and was frowning portentously
over her unusual duties as housekeeper, when
Nathalie brought her the news. She made a grimace
and then proceeded to inform Nathalie of the approaching
arrival of the <i>Vortex</i>, subduing as best
she could the tremor of excitement in her voice.
Nathalie was jubilant. At last the dull days were
at an end, and they would start on a new round
of festivities. While she was chattering volubly
it suddenly occurred to Jean that it would be a
pleasant welcome to Helen and Miss Stuart to ask
Mr. Dudley and Farr to dinner. She made the suggestion
timidly, for she feared that Nathalie would
divine the true motive which prompted her. Her
mind was instantly set at rest, for Nathalie, overjoyed
at the break in the monotony, gave her a
friendly push toward the desk to hasten the writing
of the notes. Jean laughingly reminded her that the
<i>Vortex</i> had not yet arrived, and then they put their
two heads together to concoct a dinner which should
quite equal one of Helen's ordering.</p>

<p>That afternoon, as they were about starting for the
station, Barnes brought back the answer from the <i>Vortex</i>.
Farr's was of so grateful and rejoicing a nature
that Jean laughed light-heartedly as she read it. It
came to her suddenly, as they were bowling along the
highroad, that in her note to him she had not mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the fact that Miss Stuart was with them, nor
had she done so in the one letter she had written him
during his absence.</p>

<p>"It was just an oversight," she said to herself.
"A mere chance."</p>

<p>A mere chance, and yet chance sometimes means
fate.</p>

<p>Helen met them with so many questions about
Gladys, the boys, and Aunt Helen, that Jean had no
opportunity to unfold her plan for dinner until Miss
Stuart had gone to her room, and she had followed
her sister into the nursery. Helen was tired and
travel-worn, but she was delighted by Jean's thoughtfulness
for Lillian's pleasure, and listened interestedly
while her sister anxiously submitted the menu for her
approval.</p>

<p>"Everything is perfect, dear," she said, putting
Gladys down from her lap and making her way out
into the hall, "but before I go to dress I must tell
Lillian that we are to have guests to dinner," and
she turned away without noting the shadow that
crossed Jean's face at the mention of Miss Stuart's
name.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart stood before her dressing-table arranging
the silver toilet articles which she had just taken
from her trunk. She had thoroughly enjoyed her
stay at Newport, and was feeling in a good humor
with all the world. She turned a bright glance of inquiry
as the door opened to admit Helen, and betrayed
a ready interest in her friend's announcement.</p>

<p>"Who are the men?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>"Two officers from the Coast Survey schooner that
is anchored here, Mr. Dudley and Mr. Farr; Valentine
Farr."</p>

<p>The little vinaigrette Miss Stuart held in her hand
dropped on the dressing-table. Her face contracted
sharply, and she made a quick instinctive movement
away from the light.</p>

<p>"Valentine Farr," she repeated slowly, keeping her
voice well under control. "It must be the same of
course."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" Helen asked the question
absent-mindedly, for she was looking about her critically,
to assure herself that everything in the room
was as it should be.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I have known him for a long while."
She had quite recovered from her surprise, and spoke
lightly, in her usual tone. "What a small world it is
after all."</p>

<p>"Dinner at seven, Lillian," Helen said to her as she
closed the door; and then she was alone.</p>

<p>"So Val is here," she murmured. "Val, of all people
in the world." She flung back her head with a
reckless laugh, and began to pace up and down the
room.</p>

<p>A flood of recollections swept over her; recollections
which stirred her with a strange emotion. How
long ago it seemed since sunny-tempered strong-willed
Val Farr had wooed her in so masterful a way. What
folly it had been, and yet a sweet folly withal! Miss
Stuart paused midway in the room. Her face softened,
and her beautiful mouth drooped tenderly. She had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
craved a splendid future which Val could not give her,
so she had thrust his love out of her heart, and filled
its place with the admiration and exactions of the gay
world in which she moved. Val's misfortunes, his
poverty, and his estrangement from his family gave
her the opportunity which she sought to jilt him.
She frowned with vexation as she recalled the look of
scorn that he had cast at her when she had laid bare
to him the aims and ambitions to which she had sacrificed
their love. And after all, it had been a useless,
needless exposure, for Val had come to her to give her
her freedom. She told herself that she had acted
wisely, she laughed to scorn the sentiment that was
so hard to stifle&mdash;but no other man had ever taken
Val's place.</p>

<p>They had met from time to time in Washington,
during the past few years, and at each fresh meeting
Farr had found himself more and more disillusioned
concerning the woman whom he had once loved.
Something of this Lillian Stuart divined, with a bitterness
of spirit which she could not quell. His indifference
stung her to the quick, and she could not
renounce the hope that she might win him back, if
only circumstances would give her the opportunity.
Miss Stuart's thoughts brought her back to the present.
She drew her brows together and stared meditatively
before her, with eyes that saw nothing of the
room around her:</p>

<p>"I wonder if Val is in love with one of these girls,
and if so which one."</p>

<p>Jean Lawrence's face flashed before her. She struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
her hands sharply together, and an angry light gleamed
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"That would be a curious way of punishing me. I
have always detested that sister of Helen's."</p>

<p>She crossed to the mirror, and gazed critically at the
picture presented there. A smile, slow and cruel,
touched her lips, and with a satisfied air of triumph
she turned away and began to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>The hands of the little French clock on the mantel
were close upon seven, when a knock came at the door
and Helen entered. She started back with a faint
gasp of admiration, as Miss Stuart turned from the
dressing-table and swept across the room to meet her.</p>

<p>"O Lillian," she cried, "how beautiful you look;
but, my dear, you will take away my guests' breath.
You know we are thoroughly informal at Hetherford."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart raised her hands to clasp a string of
pearls about her throat, with slow deliberation.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she said distantly, "that my gown
does not meet with your approval. I can easily
change it."</p>

<p>"Why Lillian, I find your gown charming, and would
not have you change it for the world; I exclaimed
simply because I did not expect to see you <i>en grande
toilette</i>."</p>

<p>"It did not occur to me that I was inappropriately
dressed, but of course I am not conversant with your
customs here."</p>

<p>The covert sneer was not lost upon Helen, and she
flushed painfully at the sharp words. With her usual
self-depreciation she felt reproached for what she considered
her lack of tact and courtesy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know how to tell you how sorry I am,
Lillian," she murmured, with deep contrition, "for my
inadvertent speech. I never knew you to look lovelier.
Won't you please believe me when I tell you that?"</p>

<p>The naïveté of the compliment touched Miss Stuart,
and she smiled gayly into Helen's troubled eyes.</p>

<p>"I admit that I did not understand you at first. I
thought that I was guilty of a social error. However,
it is all right now."</p>

<p>Helen put her hand on her shoulder, and turned her
gently around.</p>

<p>"I want to really see your gown. It is exquisite.
What perfect taste you have, Lillian."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart's gown was of the palest shade of green
velvet, made so simply as to be almost severe in its
lines. The low-cut bodice was ornamented with some
fine cut jet, and a little dagger of the same was
thrust through the soft coil of auburn hair which
crowned her small and shapely head. Her neck and
arms shone dazzlingly fair, and the contour of the
firm white throat would have delighted the eyes of an
artist. The long straight lines of her gown accentuated
her height, which was somewhat above the average,
and she carried herself with regal grace.</p>

<p>Helen gazed at her a moment in silent admiration.
She absolutely worshiped beauty, and its power over
her was very great. Had anyone hinted to her that
it was chiefly this in Miss Stuart which so charmed her,
she would have indignantly refuted the accusation,
and yet in a great measure it was true. Many and
many a time she had cause to puzzle over her friend&mdash;aye,
almost to distrust and fear her; but the power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the girl's great beauty blinded her and left her helpless
to condemn one who possessed such infinite
attraction.</p>

<p>The silence lasted but a moment, yet Miss Stuart
had read Helen's verdict in her transparent face, and
her pulses quickened with triumphant hope.</p>

<p>"Well, well," she cried laughingly, at length, "are
you spellbound, and have you forgotten your guests?"</p>

<p>Helen cast a hurried glance at the clock.</p>

<p>"Why, it is seven. I must run down at once. Follow
me as soon as you can, dear."</p>

<p>Down in the drawing-room, Jean was wandering
restlessly about, too excited to keep still for one moment.
She wore the simplest of her gowns, but one
which Farr had once told her he liked. Jean was
almost without vanity, but to-night, as she passed the
long mirror over the mantel, she could not refrain
from glancing therein. She was counting the slow-footed
moments, and at every turn her eyes consulted
the old Dutch clock in the corner. At last a carriage
drove up the graveled road, there were steps upon
the veranda, and the front door opened and closed
again. She longed to run out into the hall, but an
overwhelming shyness deterred her; and even as she
halted, irresolute, the portières were pushed apart, and,
as in a dream, she saw Farr coming toward her. Her
heart beat so she could not trust her voice to speak
him greeting.</p>

<p>He caught both her hands in his, and held them
closely.</p>

<p>"Jean, do you know how glad I am to see you
again?" he whispered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly she raised her eyes to meet his. The depth
of her emotion paled her cheek, and her young face
wore a look of awe. Farr's heart bounded with joy,
and he would have spoken, but suddenly she flushed
crimson and, wrenching her hands from his, started
forward to meet Dudley, who stood in the doorway, uncertain
whether to advance or beat a retreat. Jean
covered her embarrassment as best she could; although
Dudley tried valiantly to put her at her ease, there
was a merry twinkle in his blue eyes which she found
very disconcerting. At that moment Helen and Nathalie
made their entrance, and Jean moved a little
apart from the others, struggling to regain her self-possession.</p>

<p>Farr had turned to appeal to her for confirmation
of some statement when a sudden lull fell upon the
buzz of conversation. Miss Stuart stood in the doorway,
her brilliant figure strikingly set against the dark
background of the dimly lighted hall-way. She surveyed
them for a brief instant with apparent nonchalance,
but that brief glance told her that it was
with Jean that Farr was talking. With slow grace
she crossed the room and gained Helen's side.</p>

<p>Farr's eyes followed Jean's, and as they reached
Miss Stuart his expression underwent a sudden change.
She was looking directly at him, and smiled faintly at
the dismay in his face.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Farr, is it so great a surprise to you to
see such an old friend in Hetherford?"</p>

<p>Farr recovered himself, instantly, and met her challenging
glance with an impenetrable smile.</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, an unexpected pleasure, Miss Stuart,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
he said with grave courtesy, and Miss Stuart was conscious
of feeling curiously baffled.</p>

<p>To Jean, watching them with dilating eyes, that
apparently meaningless incident seemed fraught with
significance. All the haunting doubts and fears, that
not twelve hours ago she had scorned as morbid
fancies, returned upon her with redoubled force.
Love, which makes us strangely blind, makes us also
strangely alert; and Jean's eyes had seen the change
in Farr's face, and as he spoke those few conventional
words, her quick ears had detected an unnatural ring
in his voice. Miss Stuart had called herself an old
friend, and yet Farr had never spoken of her. Jean
searched her memory to see if it were possible that
she had never mentioned Miss Stuart's name to him,
and, as she thus pondered, a chance sentence of
Nathalie's reached her:</p>

<p>"You go through the shrubbery&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She heard no more. In an instant the scene was
clear before her&mdash;the long stretch of lawn beyond the
shrubbery, bright in the silver moonlight, the sound
of voices from the parsonage, breaking softly upon
the evening stillness, through which Farr and she
walked slowly side by side. Then she had spoken of
Miss Stuart, and he had certainly disclaimed any
acquaintance with her. Her heart grew cold as her
first doubt of her lover found lodgment there. As if
in consummation of her thoughts, she looked up to
see Farr offer Miss Stuart his arm. With a sense of
foreboding she followed them slowly into the dining
room, smiling a little drearily as she remembered
with what eagerness she had anticipated this dinner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>Farr's place at table was between Miss Stuart and
Jean, and as they took their seats, he spoke to the
latter in a carefully lowered tone:</p>

<p>"You can't imagine how delightful it is to be here
again. I was absolutely homesick for the manor while
I was away."</p>

<p>"Indeed? How unhappy you must have been."</p>

<p>"I was," he replied gravely, observing for the first
time the girl's air of disdain, and wondering at the
cause thereof, "and I shall have a new cause for
sorrow if you look at me as you are now doing."</p>

<p>Jean's levity was somewhat forced as she replied:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry you are not pleased. I do not find
it easy to change my expression."</p>

<p>"No?" He bent a very direct and earnest gaze
upon her. "Why, Miss Jean," he said softly, "I
thought we were friends when I went away; and only
to-night you seemed glad at my return."</p>

<p>The last spark of resentment died out of Jean's
heart. Her distrust of him seemed suddenly both
groundless and foolish. Ashamed and contrite, she
was about to speak, when Miss Stuart's suave voice
broke in upon them:</p>

<p>"Mr. Farr, have you heard anything of the Saunders
since you left Washington?"</p>

<p>Farr had no alternative but to reply to so direct
a question, and Jean, although annoyed at the unwelcome
interruption, waited patiently, confident that
he would seize upon the first opportunity to resume
his conversation with her. As the moments passed,
however, and his undivided attention was still given
to Miss Stuart, she was first hurt, and then bitterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
angry. A lump rose in her throat, and for one miserable
moment she thought she was going to cry; then
her pride came to her rescue, and under an almost
reckless gayety of speech and manner she hid her
momentary weakness. It was unjust and unreasonable
to blame Farr, but Jean was in no frame of mind
for logical argument. He had turned away from her
to speak to Miss Stuart, and although she had given
him ample time to take up the broken thread of their
discourse, he had failed to do so. As she talked on
excitedly with Dudley, her cheeks burning, her eyes
dark and restless, she was mentally comparing herself
with Miss Stuart, whom she had already almost unconsciously
begun to regard as her rival. She had
always known that Helen's friend was beautiful, but
to-night her newly awakened jealousy caused her to
lay great stress on the brilliancy and fascination of
their guest. She recalled, with curious distinctness,
the image of herself which the mirror had shown her
while she awaited Farr's coming, and her heart contracted
as she thought how colorless she must appear
in contrast with Miss Stuart's rich and vivid
beauty.</p>

<p>When at length Farr was once more at liberty to
address her, she had worked herself up to such a pitch
of miserable jealousy that she would have none of him,
and took an almost savage delight in thwarting his
every attempt at speech with her. He was too reserved
to let her see how deeply he was wounded by
her flippancy and incivility, and, in his apparent indifference,
Jean found an added proof of his disloyalty
and of her own unpardonable folly. She had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
almost come to the end of her courage, when Helen
rose, giving the signal to the ladies to withdraw.</p>

<p>Helen sat down before the open piano, and Nathalie
picked up her mandolin from the music stand and began
to tune it. When she had finished she spoke in a
low tone to her sister:</p>

<p>"Let's play Guy's old favorite, will you, dear?"</p>

<p>Helen complied, but not before she had cast a half-guilty
glance across the room to where Miss Stuart was
gracefully reclining in a huge armchair, to satisfy herself
that the mention of her lover's name had escaped
her friend's notice. The piano took up the accompanying
strains of a soft <i>andante</i>, the mandolin carrying
the air with its tremulous and strangely human
wail.</p>

<p>Jean leaned her face on her hand as she nestled
down among the cushions on the divan. Her good
angel was whispering to her in the sweet harmony of
the music, and gentler thoughts of her lover were prevailing
against the cruel doubts of him which her
jealousy had taught her. After all, had not Miss
Stuart been chiefly at fault, and had he not honestly
striven to make amends?</p>

<p>"It is entirely the result of my morbid dislike of
that girl," she said to herself; and when the officers
came out from the dining room, she gave Farr a
bright glance of welcome, and when he had joined
her, she talked to him until her persistent gentleness
had completely melted away the barrier of reserve
which had crept between them. Once or twice it was
on the tip of her tongue to say, "Why did you never
tell me that you knew Miss Stuart?" but the words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
held back by a foolish sentiment of pride, never
passed her lips.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Farr, although touched by the sweet
friendliness, was more disheartened than he quite
cared to own. He had allowed his hope to grow too
quickly, founded on that one honest glance from
Jean's eyes, a glance so full of love and trust that he
had felt he could not be deceived. Scarcely had he
told himself that his happiness was assured when
Jean's coldness had denied the love which her eyes
had bespoken. No suspicion of the truth had crossed
his mind, and as Jean had never been given to moods,
he was left to the discouraging conclusion that he had
been too hasty and that she was resenting it. She
was willing now to treat him with her old-time cordial
frankness, for having once clearly defined their
relative positions, she was too courteous to continue
a course of treatment which she must have seen had
greatly pained him. Never until he had reached this
unhappy decision had he realized how strong and
deep-rooted was his love for Jean. As his eyes rested
on her, a longing seized him to take her in his arms,
and to bring back to her face that look which had
given him such promise of joy.</p>

<p>His unexpected meeting with Miss Stuart had
brought back to his memory the foolish impetuosity,
the passionate unrest of his boyish love for her, and
he thanked God for the wholesome lesson he had
learned, and prayed earnestly for the love of this young
girl, whose truth and sincerity stirred all the dormant
possibilities of his higher nature. With these thoughts
in his mind his eyes wandered across the room to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
where Lillian Stuart sat talking with Dudley. He acknowledged
the force and charm of her rare exotic
beauty, but it moved him not at all. Her effective
pose was studied and artificial. Her face, so perfect
in contour, was lacking in any suggestion of tender
womanliness, and her glorious eyes, now raised to
Dudley's, although full of the power of expression,
revealed no depth of soul.</p>

<p>It was refreshing to him to turn once more to Jean,
to meet the dear laughter-loving eyes, to watch the
fleeting changes of expression on her bonny face, to
mark the unconscious grace of every movement of
her lithe, slender figure. Yet, the secret of Jean's
strong hold on his heart lay not in these superficial
attractions, nor in her frank simplicity of manner, nor
yet in her girlish freshness, which was her greatest
claim to beauty, but in the knowledge he had gained
of her true nature; a nature so honest, so unfailing
in loyalty, so unselfish, so charitable, so responsive in
its sympathies, that both respect and reverence were
blended with his love for her. And yet he was not
wholly blind to her faults. He knew that she was
impatient and hot-tempered, and that, in anger, she
was often sarcastic and cutting; but he also saw that
she made a brave effort to hold herself in check, and
that, however she might be worsted, she never ceased
to struggle for the mastery. His meditations had
carried him far adrift of the conversation, but although
Jean had observed his abstraction, she did
not resent it. She was living in a day-dream herself,
a dream that was all the happier for that miserable
hour at the dinner-table. She rose with a regretful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
sigh when Helen asked her to go up with a message
to Aunt Helen. She looked up at Farr as he held
back the portière for her to pass, and impulsively put
out her hand to him.</p>

<p>"We are friends again, are we not?" she asked
scarcely above her breath.</p>

<p>Farr gripped the little hand so tightly it almost
hurt her.</p>

<p>"Only friends, Jean?" was all he said; but Jean
was satisfied.</p>

<p>Aunt Helen detained her for some few moments
with questions about the dinner, and when at last she
was free Mary called to her to please step into the
nursery, for Larry was wakeful and naughty and
would not be quiet. Quite a half-hour had passed
before she re-entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>She paused on the threshold, attracted by Farr's
voice. He was seated just within the doorway. His
back was turned toward her and he faced Miss
Stuart, who was leaning slightly forward in her chair.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," he was saying. "I remember
everything about that evening, to the color of the
gown you wore."</p>

<p>Before the conclusion of this sentence Miss Stuart
had detected Jean, half hidden by the heavy portière.</p>

<p>"Those were pleasant days in Washington, Val,"
she said, accompanying the words with a faint
sigh.</p>

<p>Jean, never dreaming that she had been seen, retreated
precipitately to a far corner of the hall, and
when she once more entered the room her face was
pale, but she held her head well up, and with a low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
"I beg your pardon," swept by the two, who still
maintained their positions.</p>

<p>That night Miss Stuart's light burned until a late
hour, and in response to Helen's gentle inquiry as to
the cause thereof she gave through the closed door,
but a curt "Good-night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XIII.<br /><br />
AN INVITATION.</h2>

<p class="p2">Wednesday brought the return of the <i>Sylph</i>
from her cruise. The men, tanned and burned
by exposure to wind and sun, were in great spirits,
and declared themselves ready for any sport that
might be suggested. The girls rallied forces, and in
solemn conclave bade them extend their vacation one
more week, that Miss Stuart might be amused and
entertained. They drew a pathetic picture of her
first week in Hetherford, and maintained that it would
be rank disloyalty to allow her to go away with such
an impression of the beloved place.</p>

<p>In the confusion of tongues two voices were silent.
Emily and Jean each had her own reason for wishing
Miss Stuart a thousand miles away, and both looked
a little contemptuous at the excitement that was being
made over her. However, their lack of interest did
not dampen the enthusiasm of the others, and the
day was carried. The men did not need a great deal
of urging, for they had already met Miss Stuart, and
were eloquent in their praises of her. Dick Andrews
succumbed at once to the tender passion, much to
everybody's amusement, for jolly Dick in the rôle of
lovesick swain was a most diverting spectacle.</p>

<p>Andrews did not have it all his own way, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
for Miss Stuart, with an exception in Farr's favor,
treated them quite impartially. It was conceded
that Farr, as an old friend, had a prior right, and
no one marveled that Miss Stuart's manner toward
him was particularly gracious and amiable. They
were much in each other's society, and so diplomatic
was Miss Stuart, that no one discerned that
their frequent <i>tête-à-têtes</i> were invariably of her
planning.</p>

<p>It must be said, however, that Farr made no resistance
and appeared eminently at ease with her.
He was sorely wounded, and as angry with Jean as
it was possible for him to be; and in this dejected
and unenviable frame of mind, he took small heed of
what he did with his time. Monday night when, at
Helen's request, Jean had left the drawing-room, she
had distinctly bade him hope. One hour later, she
had again veered round and had treated him with a
contemptuous indifference which he felt he had in no
way deserved. Even then he had tried to believe
that his imagination was at fault, but when she had
purposely overlooked the hand which he had extended
to her in parting, he could no longer deceive himself.
Unfortunately, Miss Stuart had seen the slight which
Jean had put upon him, and the faint smile of amusement
in her eyes when she had said, "good-night" to
him but deepened the sting. In a tempest of rage
he flung himself out of the house and strode furiously
down the avenue, leaving poor Dudley far behind, to
wonder what on earth was the matter.</p>

<p>It was not easy for Farr with his nature to forgive
a repulse, and on Tuesday he kept to the <i>Vortex</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
nursing his wrongs, and vowing he would take no
step to make matters right between them until Jean
should show some sign of penitence. By Wednesday
this determination was less firm, and during the hours
of his work and leisure his heart was pleading for
Jean. When evening came he gave up the struggle,
and at nine o'clock presented himself at the manor.</p>

<p>The light that streamed out through the open door
and windows revealed quite a number of people on
the veranda, and he remembered that he had observed
the <i>Sylph</i> riding at anchor in the harbor. They gave
him a hearty welcome, and while Nathalie was rallying
him for his unkind desertion of them, he vainly
tried to discover Jean's whereabouts. His inability
to do so was soon explained.</p>

<p>"Where did Jean go?" Nathalie asked.</p>

<p>Eleanor answered from the corner of the veranda:</p>

<p>"She went in the house a little while ago."</p>

<p>"Send Susie up for her, Nathalie," Helen requested.</p>

<p>Farr took a seat on the railing at a point which
commanded a view of the hall; and found himself
face to face with Miss Stuart, who was tilting slowly
back and forth in a deep rocker. They had interchanged
one or two commonplace remarks when a
maid tripped across the hall and stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Miss Jean begs to be excused," she announced
briefly, and disappeared into the darkened dining
room beyond.</p>

<p>Farr drew a quick breath, and a frown contracted
his brows. He could scarcely believe that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
heard aright. With a characteristic gesture, he
pulled his cap down over his eyes and set his teeth.
Miss Stuart remembered the trick of old. She
watched him furtively, with a curious light in her
eyes. Suddenly he recalled her existence, but when
he looked at her she had already averted her gaze
and was apparently quite unconscious that anything
of importance had taken place.</p>

<p>She gave him a few moments in which to recover
himself, and then addressed to him some passing observation
on a subject quite alien to Hetherford or
the Hetherford girls. Farr, animated by a strong
desire to hide his pain and disappointment from every
eye, braced himself and replied in a vein of lightness
which satisfied her that she had been wise in the
course which she had adopted. They drifted quite
naturally into conventional small-talk, and every moment
he gained more assurance and ease. He was
positively grateful for Miss Stuart's presence, for it
afforded him a refuge from intercourse with those
simple-hearted Hetherford girls, which he felt would,
just now, be very disastrous to his self-control. No
thought of danger assailed him. He believed Miss
Stuart's sentiment for him to be quite dead; and as
for himself he had so completely outlived every trace
of his boyish passion as to have even lost all feeling
of resentment against her. He congratulated himself
with true masculine density that he had probed
the depths of Miss Stuart's nature, and could never
be outwitted by her again. Some day, if things went
well with him, he meant to tell Jean all about that
affair; in fact, he would have done so Monday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
evening, had he not felt that it would scarcely be in
good taste to discuss the subject with Miss Stuart
almost within ear-shot. In the meantime it did not
distress him in the least to defer the telling of the
story; for Jean, of course, knew nothing whatever of
the matter, and it was extremely improbable that Miss
Stuart would ever take the pains to enlighten her. In
justice to Farr it should be said that he had completely
forgotten the incident of the shrubbery which
had meant so much to Jean, and he was not aware of
the words that she had overheard, and of the construction
that she had not unnaturally put upon them.</p>

<p>And all this while poor little Jean lay on the sofa,
in her darkened room, sobbing as if her heart would
break. She had waited so patiently on Tuesday,
hoping against hope that he would come and explain
everything to her. For, of course, there was something
to explain, else why had he so distinctly avoided
all mention of Miss Stuart, even when she had asked
him if he knew her?</p>

<p>"He has a right to his past," she said to herself,
with quivering lips; "but, oh! if they were such old
friends, if she calls him Val, if he remembers one
evening with her even to the color of her gown, he
might&mdash;oh! he might have remembered to speak of
her to me."</p>

<p>The more she thought it over the greater seemed
the proofs of his deception. If he and Miss Stuart
had been old friends and nothing more, it would have
been his natural impulse to speak of his surprise and
pleasure at meeting her at the manor. He had failed
to do so, and, with despair in her heart, Jean told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
herself that he must have had some strong reason for
his silence.</p>

<p>Tuesday wore away, and still no word had come
from him. She determined not to let Miss Stuart see
how unhappy she was, so kept about with the others,
and entered into all their plans with forced gayety.
When half-past nine struck on Wednesday evening,
she gave up all hope of seeing him, for they were very
informal in Hetherford, and kept early hours. She
went up to her room, and as she slipped on her
wrapper, she fell to crying, and when Susie knocked
and announced Farr, she was too disfigured by her
tears to think of going down. The disappointment
was very keen.</p>

<p>"Please excuse me, Susie," she called through
the closed door. "I am sorry, but I am lying
down."</p>

<p>As she heard the maid's retreating step she would
fain have recalled her, and sent some other message,
but it was too late.</p>

<p>The next day, on the decks of the <i>Sylph</i>, Farr
and Jean met for the first time since Monday. Jean
came aboard fully resolved to tender an apology for
having excused herself on the previous evening. She
had never lacked self-confidence before, but to-day
she could scarcely pluck up courage to speak to him.
Timidly she made her first friendly overtures, only to
be met with an unmistakable rebuff. Farr answered
the questions she put to him, but with a studied indifference
which made her cheeks tingle; to make matters
worse he presently sauntered off from the group
of which Jean made one, and joined Miss Stuart, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
was seated a short distance away. Jean's face grew
hard as she stifled the sob which rose in her throat,
and she registered a vow that never again would she
give him an opportunity to treat her so slightingly.
It was unmanly and unmannerly, and she had done
with him forever. She did not flinch from the path
she laid out for herself, and so successfully did she
play the part that Dick and Mollie, walking home in
the cool of the evening, declared that it was like the
good old days to have Jean so jolly and full of fun.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart meanwhile was content to keep Farr at
her side, despite the fact that he was a most morose
and taciturn companion. She knew wherein lay her
advantage, and although the knowledge was not flattering
to her self-pride, it did not prevent her from
making the best of her opportunities. It was galling
to her that Jean had the power to make him so miserable,
but the trouble between them served her purpose
very well for the present. As she talked to him
pleasantly, she did not seem to notice that his replies
were monosyllabic, and that he watched Jean's every
movement with gloomy eyes. She was a clever
woman, with a rare gift of conversation, and ere long
her tactful efforts were rewarded, and Farr, roused
from his abstraction, shook himself out of his ill-humor.
In the course of the day he made one or
two attempts at a reconciliation with Jean, but as
both she and Miss Stuart had concentrated their energies
to prevent his accomplishing his purpose, he
failed signally.</p>

<p>As day followed day, the breach between Jean and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
her lover was not healed, and no hand was stretched
forth to stay its ever-widening limits.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>"Lillian!"</p>

<p>Miss Stuart laid down her book, and looked expectantly
up at Helen.</p>

<p>"I have a suggestion to make for this afternoon.
How would you like to drive over to Crescent Beach
to call on Mrs. Maynard?"</p>

<p>"I agree to the drive," replied Miss Stuart, stifling a
yawn, "but why must we call on that stupid woman?
She always bores me to death."</p>

<p>There was a ring of annoyance in Helen's voice as
she answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not at all necessary for you to go with
me. One of my sisters would be delighted to do so."</p>

<p>"So much the better, my dear," said Miss Stuart
indifferently, as she picked up her book and resumed
her reading.</p>

<p>"Why are you so down on little Mrs. Maynard?"
queried Wendell Churchill, emerging from a recess
of the window where he and Nathalie had been whiling
away the morning hours with mandolin and banjo.</p>

<p>"I am not down on her in the least, but I think she
is uninteresting to a degree."</p>

<p>She paused until the portières had closed on
Helen's retreating figure, and then met Churchill's
eyes with a meaning smile.</p>

<p>"It is not surprising, is it, that her husband should
find Mrs. Desborough a pleasing contrast?"</p>

<p>In her far-away corner hot-tempered Nathalie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
caught the words and flared up in defense of her
friend:</p>

<p>"Oh, I think it is a shame to speak so. Mrs.
Maynard is unhappy, but no woman ever bore unhappiness
with greater dignity. It seems to me
incredible that everybody's sympathies are not enlisted
on her side."</p>

<p>"I am very unfortunate," returned Miss Stuart
with thinly veiled sarcasm. "This is the second
time I have erred in this way. I must be more
careful in future not to give expression to my
opinions."</p>

<p>Churchill saw that some unpleasantness was imminent,
and, manlike, rushed in only to make matters
worse.</p>

<p>"Don't you think Miss Nathalie looks very much
like Mrs. Desborough? I have so often noticed the
resemblance."</p>

<p>With blazing eyes, Nathalie started up from the
low window-seat.</p>

<p>"From all I know of her, I cannot feel flattered
by the compliment," and, with this parting shot, she
thrust open the French windows and flew out on the
veranda.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," murmured Miss Stuart in mock dismay,
"what a tempest in a teapot. Those girls are
terribly spoiled, and it is all Helen's fault. She is
unpardonably weak with them."</p>

<p>Churchill was very much embarrassed by the position
in which he found himself. He extricated himself
by muttering something barely intelligible, to the
effect that the Lawrences were so much attached to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
each other, and then retreated hastily to find Nathalie
and reinstate himself in her good graces.</p>

<p>When afternoon came Miss Stuart relented and she
and Helen, with little Gladys between them, started
off in the buckboard for Crescent Beach. It was a
beautiful drive. For a short distance the road wound
through fragrant meadows and wooded lanes until it
came out upon the beach, where for several miles it
led straight away over the hardened sands. They
bowled swiftly along, the fresh salt wind blowing in
their faces, the soothing sound of the ebb and flow of
the restless waters breaking softly on their ears.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart, exhilarated by the clear air, the brilliant
sunshine and the congenial companionship of this
friend whom she really loved, had never appeared to
a greater advantage. It was the Lillian Stuart who
might have been whose cleverness and glancing wit
held Helen's mind enthralled, as they talked of all the
subjects dear to women's hearts. All too soon they
reached their destination. As they drew up under the
<i>porte-cochère</i> of the hotel, Helen found herself wishing
with all her heart that Lillian might continue in so
charming a mood.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Maynard joined them in the vast
hotel parlor, and as Miss Stuart went forward to greet
her with great cordiality, Helen had no fault to find
with her manner. They chatted together for some
few moments when Miss Stuart recognized some
friends of hers in a party of people who had wandered
in from the piazza. She excused herself, and as she
joined them Mrs. Maynard turned to Helen.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to come up to my room for a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
moments, Helen? I am sure that Dorothy would be
very glad to see Gladys."</p>

<p>The child jumped instantly down from her chair,
her chubby face beaming with eager anticipation.</p>

<p>"Gladys has accepted for me," said Helen with an
amused smile, and the two made their way upstairs.</p>

<p>"What a lovely view you have!" exclaimed Helen
as she dropped into a chair near the open window.</p>

<p>"It is pretty," Mrs. Maynard assented, pushing open
a door which led into the next room.</p>

<p>A beautiful little child sat in the middle of the floor,
hugging a big woolly lamb close to her heart.</p>

<p>"Dorothy, will you please come here, and speak to
little Gladys Lawrence, who has come to see you?"</p>

<p>At her mother's bidding, Dorothy struggled to her
feet, and clutching the lamb tightly in both hands, ran
toward the open door. Then she caught sight of
Helen, and the big violet eyes were swiftly veiled, and
the little head with its tangled mass of golden curls
was hidden in the folds of her mother's skirt. Mrs.
Maynard smiled in gentle reproof as she lifted the
child's face.</p>

<p>"What a baby, darling! Please be a good little girl
and say 'how-do-you-do' to Gladys."</p>

<p>Dorothy still hung back, clinging fast to her mother's
hand; but Gladys, who was the most friendly little
creature in the world, soon succeeded in overcoming
her shyness. Presently they were chattering together
as happily as possible, and Dorothy went so far as to
produce her box of paper dolls and to dress them for
Gladys' benefit.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maynard's face lighted up with sympathetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
interest as Helen gave her a graphic account of the
week's gayeties. She had known Miss Stuart for
several years, and could well understand Helen's desire
to make her visit enjoyable. Miss Stuart, bored,
might be a very difficult companion.</p>

<p>"I am so glad for you, Helen, dear, that you have
had such pleasant times. I wish you would let me
feel that I had contributed in a small way toward
helping you to entertain Miss Stuart, and, if you would
enjoy it, I would love to have you all come over here
for the dance on Saturday evening. I believe they
are to have very good music, and we will arrange to
have a pleasant little supper together. My husband
will be here, and I expect Mr. and Mrs. Endicott,
whom you may remember."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I do, and I know that I can accept
for all of us. It will be moonlight, so the drive over
will be delightful."</p>

<p>On the way home little else was talked of between
the girls but the prospective dance. Miss Stuart
expressed herself as very much pleased with the idea,
and the plan having received the sanction of her
approval, Helen forthwith determined that every
arrangement should be as perfect as her careful forethought
could make it.</p>

<p>When they reached the manor, the girls were
having tea on the upper porch. They joined them at
once, and the question of the dance was laid before
them.</p>

<p>"Glorious!" exclaimed Nathalie, ecstatically, and
her verdict was loudly echoed by the others.</p>

<p>Helen drew a chair up close to the tea-table over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
which Jean was presiding, and pulling off her gloves
smoothed them out on her knee with the palm of her
hand.</p>

<p>"I want to consult you in regard to the drive,
Jeanie," she said in a lowered tone.</p>

<p>Jean nodded, and leaned across her, to hand a cup
of tea to Miss Stuart.</p>

<p>"Nathalie," said Helen, "please give Lillian some
of that hot toast."</p>

<p>"Toast and jam!" exclaimed Nan in accents of
scorn, as she helped herself generously to both.
"What sordid considerations, when there is a <i>bona
fide</i> ball in view."</p>

<p>"Leave a slice for me, Nancy," laughed Eleanor.
"I must fortify myself if you are going to wax eloquent."</p>

<p>"Stop your nonsense, girls," and Nathalie waved
an imperious hand at them. "The question is, how
shall we drive over?"</p>

<p>Jean turned to Helen.</p>

<p>"If it is a fine night we might go in the wagonette."</p>

<p>"Why, Jean, it would not begin to hold us all,"
interposed Emily. "There are fourteen of us, counting
the men from the <i>Vortex</i>."</p>

<p>"I did not include them," Jean replied quietly.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart stared curiously at her over the edge
of her teacup.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that a dance without men is
rather a tame affair, and I don't imagine the hotel
will yield a very plentiful supply."</p>

<p>Jean lifted her chin defiantly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>"I was not speaking of the dance but of the drive
over."</p>

<p>"Well, that is perfectly absurd," Emily broke in.
"The idea of our going over in one conveyance, and
those poor men in another. What are you thinking
of, Jean?"</p>

<p>Miss Stuart laughed softly, while Jean vouchsafed
never a word.</p>

<p>A glance of intelligence was flashed from Nan to
Eleanor, and Nan spoke up in good-natured raillery.</p>

<p>"Em, dear, have you ever heard that 'enough is as
good as a feast.' Jean probably remembered that it
it is fully twelve miles there and back and felt some
qualms for fear her conversational ability would
desert her."</p>

<p>The laugh was general, for it was a joke of long
standing that Jean could talk to anyone, at any time,
and under any circumstances, however trying.</p>

<p>Helen looked from one to the other with puzzled
eyes. She had an uncomfortable consciousness that
there was something in the air which she did not understand.
She put an end to the discussion with
quiet decision.</p>

<p>"There will be quite time enough to talk this over
later. We must wait and see how the weather turns
out. Now, suppose we go downstairs and have some
music before we break up."</p>

<p>Later that evening she opened the subject again
to Miss Stuart.</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I have decided, Lillian. We
will hire the Hetherford stage and all go over in
that."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>And Miss Stuart answered, with a tinge of triumph
in her voice:</p>

<p>"That is certainly a most sensible plan, my dear."</p>

<p>So it was settled. Jean accepted the decision without
a protest. Deep in her heart she still cherished a
strong hope that the misunderstandings between Farr
and herself might one day be cleared away. She had
acted contrary to her own wishes in excluding him
from the drive to Crescent Beach, and she admitted
to herself, shamefacedly, that she was glad the matter
had been taken out of her hands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XIV.<br /><br />
A DANCE AT CRESCENT BEACH.</h2>

<p class="p2">A very merry party of people assembled at the
manor on Saturday evening. Nathalie flitted
about among them with dancing feet and shining
eyes, and one and all caught the spirit of her contagious
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lark it is," she cried. "It is full
moon to-night, and everything has gone right from
beginning to end."</p>

<p>"The end is not yet, Miss Nathalie," Farr said to
her with a faint smile.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and laughed light-heartedly.</p>

<p>"Don't be cynical. It is a bad habit."</p>

<p>"The moon is rising," interposed Jean, turning
about from the open doorway. "It is too lovely to
stay indoors."</p>

<p>A hush fell upon them as they followed her out
upon the veranda. Sentences left unfinished, gay
laughter checked on the lips, paid tribute to the
impressive beauty of the scene. Far away in the
east the moon, with slow and stately grace, lifted its
splendor above the dark line of the horizon. Against
its flaming glory were sharply defined the somber
trunks of sturdy oaks and spreading elms. Seen between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
their leafy branches lay the Sound, obscured a
moment since by an impenetrable veil of darkness,
but reflecting now on its rippling surface the golden
light of the rising orb. The night air pulsed with the
cheery chirp of the cricket, the monotonous chant of
the katy-did. Softly the south wind blew rustling
among the trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>Nathalie was the first to speak. Her quick ear had
caught the sound of wheels.</p>

<p>"Here comes the stage at last. Do let us get off
right away."</p>

<p>"Is everyone here?" queried Mrs. Andrews,
looking around on the bevy of pretty girls with a
smile of complacent satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Everyone but Lillian," Helen answered. "We
may as well begin to take our places. She will be
down in a few moments."</p>

<p>Already the stage had backed up before the door,
and Jean was among the first to run lightly down the
broad flight of steps. Farr stood at the foot, and as
he held out his hand to assist her, she saw that he
was regarding her sadly. There was no time for
words, the others were flocking down the steps behind
them. She turned her eyes to meet his with a
plaintive, almost appealing smile. She thought they
must have spoken for her, for ere he released her
hand he gave it a quick pressure.</p>

<p>It was some few moments before Miss Stuart made
her appearance. She descended the steps slowly,
with no suggestion of haste. Farr held open the
door for her to enter.</p>

<p>"Come up here by me, Lillian," Helen called to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
her from the other end of the stage, but she did not
seem to hear the request, and slipped into a seat near
the door.</p>

<p>Farr sprang lightly in, but as he would have passed
her she laid a detaining hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of room here," she said, indicating
the place beside her, and he had no alternative
but to take it.</p>

<p>The other men crowded past them, and as the stage
lurched forward, Cliff Archer dropped into a seat
between Jean and Eleanor.</p>

<p>"A great deal of strength is wasted in undue
haste," he observed lazily. "I find that laggards
invariably prosper."</p>

<p>"What heresy, Cliff," laughed Eleanor softly, with
an expressive glance in Miss Stuart's direction.</p>

<p>Cliff appealed to Jean.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine anything more barefaced than
that attempt to extort a compliment. From a sheer
sense of duty I feel compelled to disappoint her."</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, struck by the expression of
Jean's face. She had evidently not heard his words,
for she was staring straight before her with strained,
unseeing eyes. Her mouth was compressed with a
look of suffering in the lines. Cliff was very fond of
Jean. He knew her better than the other girls, for
she and Eleanor were such fast friends. He did not
stop to ponder on the cause of her unhappiness, but
hastily resolved to shield her if possible. Eleanor
leaned forward to speak to her across him, but he
brought his slender figure between them.</p>

<p>"You can talk to Jean all day, and every day. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
is my turn to-night, my dear, and I intend to monopolize
you to my heart's content."</p>

<p>When Cliff spoke in that tone Eleanor knew there
was no appeal to be made, so she yielded the point at
once with very good grace.</p>

<p>As the stage jolted lumberingly on its way, Jean
saw nothing of the beauty of the night, heard nothing
of the merry laughter, the gay snatches of song which
reverberated around her. It was, perhaps, a trifling
circumstance that Farr had seated himself quite at
the other end of the stage, and at Miss Stuart's side,
but to Jean, in her unhappy state of mind, it meant a
great deal. To her the interchange of glances a few
moments since had been tantamount to a truce between
them. She had been so sure that Farr would
make an effort to secure a place beside her that she
had purposely crowded up in the corner, leaving a
space for him between Eleanor and herself. Her
humiliation was poignant, complete. The wound to
vanity was beneficial in its effect, rousing all her self-respect,
and determining her to hide the truth from
Farr at all hazards.</p>

<p>"I must be brave," she said to herself resolutely.
"I must let him see that I am happy and light-hearted,"
and she closed her lips firmly to still their
quivering. She was quite mistress of herself by the
time the hotel was reached.</p>

<p>The Maynards, with their friends the Endicotts,
awaited them on the brilliantly lighted veranda, and
as they descended from the stage with merry jest and
laughter, Maynard left his wife's side and ran down
the steps to welcome them. He was a good-looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
man, with a particularly charming and cordial manner.
He had never given much thought to the Hetherford
girls; in his mind he stigmatized them as provincial
and uninteresting; but to-night, as Jean, standing in
the full glare of the hotel office, unwound the scarf
from around her neck, and flung back her wrap, an
exclamation of surprise rose to his lips.</p>

<p>Jean was, indeed, looking very lovely. There were
faint shadows under the deep blue eyes, the sweet
mouth drooped slightly, lending new beauty and
depth of expression to her face. Maynard hastened
to offer her his arm, and they moved slowly down the
long hall to the entrance of the ball-room. The
music had just begun when Farr's voice fell on Jean's
ears. At his first words she turned a startled face
toward him:</p>

<p>"Miss Lawrence, I believe this is our dance. Sorry
to deprive you, Maynard," and before Jean could
recover from her astonishment, Maynard had bowed
himself away and Farr was smiling gravely down at
her.</p>

<p>"Please don't be angry, Miss Jean. 'Nothing venture
nothing have,' you know, and I have had so little
lately."</p>

<p>Jean looked up at him helplessly at a loss for an
answer.</p>

<p>"I want the waltz very much," he added in a tone
of pleading.</p>

<p>She laughed a bit unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I will dance with you, although
I must confess your mode of asking me is very
strange."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"'All is fair in&mdash;&mdash;' Which is it, Jean?" he asked
softly as they fell into the measure of the waltz.</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes, glad that at present no reply
was required of her. When the last strain had died
away, Farr drew her hand through his arm, and they
threaded their way among the crowd out into the cool
hall-way.</p>

<p>"Is this your wrap?" he queried, selecting one
from the number that were thrown across a chair.
"Now let us go outside for a little stroll."</p>

<p>They made their way out on to the little veranda,
which on this side of the hotel was built on a ledge
of rocks, and overhung the waters of Crescent Bay.
Avoiding the rank and file of dancers, who were now
promenading slowly up and down, they crossed to
the railing and stood there gazing silently before
them. In the harbor below myriads of boats lay at
anchor, all gayly decorated in honor of the occasion.
Further out the moon's bright radiance fell softly on
the tremulous waves, and across its golden sheen a
white-winged yacht sped silently on its way.</p>

<p>By and by, Jean roused herself with a slight effort:</p>

<p>"What Philistinism it is to illuminate the veranda
with those ugly lanterns. Their flaring light quite
spoils the effect of the moonlight."</p>

<p>Her poor little commonplace attempt to open the
conversation met with disastrous failure. Farr muttered
inattentively "Yes, indeed," and relapsed into
silence again.</p>

<p>In the long pause that ensued the monotonous splash
of the waves against the rocks below sounded deliciously
cool and refreshing. A rowboat shot out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
from the pier, skimming the darkened waters under
the lea of the shore.</p>

<p>Farr drew nearer to Jean and spoke with deep
earnestness:</p>

<p>"We cannot take up the thread of the past, Miss
Jean, with this constraint between us, but I am not
willing to let it go without an attempt at an explanation.
Will you not tell me what I have done to have
forfeited your friendship?"</p>

<p>Jean's head was bent, her few words of dissent
almost inaudible. Farr interrupted her in a voice
that was both pained and stern.</p>

<p>"Please don't deny it. I cannot have forfeited the
right to your honesty. Did I presume too much on
your great kindness to me, Jean?"</p>

<p>"No, oh no!" she cried hastily, with a little
break in her voice. "Indeed you must not think
that."</p>

<p>A man's step approached them, and stopped at
Jean's side.</p>

<p>"Miss Lawrence," Maynard's voice said, "the next
waltz is ours. Shall I find you here?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," she replied with a forced laugh.
"I shall not vanish."</p>

<p>"I wanted to assure myself of the pleasure. One
is easily lost among all these people," he answered
lightly, as he turned away.</p>

<p>Farr's face darkened.</p>

<p>"What right has Maynard to monopolize you?" he
demanded savagely. "He is a married man, and not
a man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was an unwise speech, and he broke off abruptly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
convicted of his folly by the expression in Jean's unflinching
eyes.</p>

<p>"You forget that Mr. Maynard is our host, Mr.
Farr," she said coldly.</p>

<p>After a moment she added more gently:</p>

<p>"I did not want you to say anything that you would
regret. I should be sorry to hear you speak ill of a
friend. It is not like you."</p>

<p>The simple words touched Farr, and made him feel
ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said contritely. "I was
a brute to speak so. The truth is, I am not myself,
and have not been during the whole of this miserable
week. I seem never to have the chance to speak with
you, and I have tortured myself with the thought that
it has been your deliberate purpose to avoid me."</p>

<p>The opening bars of the waltz, and Maynard's
approach, cut short his words. Slowly the trio forced
their way through the moving crowd until they had
gained the entrance to the ball-room. Farr stood
listlessly in the doorway as Maynard whirled Jean
away from him across the polished floor. Some
minutes later, someone touched his elbow and he
turned with a start to meet Miss Stuart's eyes:</p>

<p>"Val, let us dance together 'for auld lang syne.'"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," he assented abstractedly, for as
she spoke he had caught a glimpse of Jean disappearing
through one of the long windows which gave on
the veranda. Miss Stuart's glance followed his, and
her eyes flashed. The carelessness of his reply hurt
her cruelly.</p>

<p>"I will make Jean suffer for this," she vowed, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
with throbbing heart she took her place among the
dancers.</p>

<p>Later, as they passed through the doorway, they
encountered Jean and Maynard re-entering the room.
Miss Stuart first caught sight of them. She raised
her glorious eyes to her companion's face, and spoke
in a voice carefully pitched to reach Jean's ears:</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Val, it is pleasant to dance together
again. It brings back those bygone happy days so
forcibly."</p>

<p>They were abreast of the other couple now, and
Farr halted. Miss Stuart's speech had quite escaped
him, absorbed as he was in watching Jean, so he was
entirely unprepared for her reception of him. As he
spoke her name she flashed a light impenetrable smile
at him, and then deliberately turned away, and he
heard her say gayly to the man at her side:</p>

<p>"Mr. Maynard, that waltz is divine. Don't let us
miss another bar of it."</p>

<p>And Maynard answered softly:</p>

<p>"Your wish is my law, Miss Jean."</p>

<p>Then the crowd surged between them, and with a
somewhat unreasonable bitterness in his heart Farr
blindly followed Miss Stuart to a secluded corner of
the veranda. Jean's treatment of him was inexplicable.
It seemed so much easier for things to go wrong
than right that he felt it was well-nigh useless to struggle
against the inevitable. Disappointed and dispirited
he paid but small heed to his beautiful companion,
who was exerting her rare tact and diplomacy
to please and divert him.</p>

<p>In the ensuing hour, Jean, all unsuspecting of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
truth, was amply avenged. Never before had it come
home to Lillian Stuart, with such convincing force,
that against Farr's love for this young girl she was
utterly powerless. In vain love taught her a new
unselfishness, a womanly gentleness quite strange to
her; in vain did she crush down the rising storm of
jealousy within her breast. Farr saw none of these
things, cared for her not at all. He sought her society
because she made so few demands upon him and
accepted his varying moods unquestioningly. If he
thought on the subject at all he explained her kindness
to him by the fact that he was possibly more in touch
with her world than anyone else in Hetherford. The
subtle charm of her personality which she had ever
found so potent was quite lost on this man whose love
she had once possessed, and had valued so lightly.
Hope was dead in her heart, but one weapon of
revenge&mdash;Jean's evident jealousy&mdash;lay within her
grasp, and this she wielded with unerring skill.</p>

<p>The music ceased, and soon the veranda was invaded
by a host of flushed and heated dancers, and
among their number Jean, with Maynard still at her
side. There was a new elasticity in her step, a new
light in her eyes, and she was flirting quite openly
and markedly with her companion. As the stream
bore them past Farr and Miss Stuart she did not
apparently observe them, withdrawn as they were into
the corner, and falling out of the line of people,
selected seats at a short distance from them.</p>

<p>Maynard, to whom a pretty woman was always
irresistible, was carried away by the girl's <i>insouciance</i>,
and fascination. He was the more delighted because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
so completely taken by surprise. He had pictured
Jean always as a little puritan who would look upon a
flirtation as the height of immorality, but to-night the
little puritan had suddenly blossomed out in a totally
unexpected and charming character. He was not a
little flattered by her evident willingness to linger on
in this quiet spot with him when the crowd had once
more sought the ball-room, and into his manner he
infused an added warmth of interest.</p>

<p>Poor Jean, however, was invulnerable. She had
never liked Mr. Maynard, although she had been
forced to admit that he was charming, and agreeable
as an acquaintance. The Hetherford girls were one
and all too sincerely fond of Mrs. Maynard to have
much patience with the man who could flagrantly
neglect so sweet and lovely a wife. It had been an
unwritten code of honor among them to treat him
with polite indifference, and to promptly snub any
attempt on his part to break down the barrier of
reserve behind which they had entrenched themselves.
Under ordinary circumstances Jean would have
despised herself for the course she was now pursuing,
but to-night the poor child was too utterly miserably
to care what she did, or what became of her. She
laughed and flirted recklessly with this man, of whom
she strongly disapproved, to quell the ache at her
heart, and when the remedy failed she but laughed
and flirted the more. It was selfish, unworthy; but
Jean was unversed in suffering, and seized upon the
means within reach to enable her to cover up her
pain and jealousy. Something of the same impulse
that influenced Farr with Miss Stuart prompted her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
to keep this man at her side. Those old friends
knew her too well, had seen too much of her with
Farr, not to have their suspicions aroused by her
feverish and exaggerated gayety.</p>

<p>At last the evening was over, and they stood in the
hotel office, awaiting the arrival of the stage. Jean
was somewhat apart from the others, with Maynard
bending over her and talking to her in lowered tones.</p>

<p>Her little foot tapped the floor nervously, her
cheeks burned hotly, and one unsteady little hand
waved a big fan to and fro. Her courage was rapidly
forsaking her, and she rallied all her strength in one
last effort to appear naturally gay and at ease. She
felt she must not break down now with Farr only a
few paces away, for, although she never raised her
eyes, yet she knew he was watching her.</p>

<p>As pretty little Mrs. Maynard moved about among
her guests, speaking to them in her softly modulated
voice, she bent a glance of anxious intentness upon
Jean. She was far too inured to her husband's
indifference to be deeply hurt by this new flirtation
carried on before her very eyes, but this new phase
in Jean's character puzzled her. But her own sad
experience had quickened her intuition of others' unhappiness,
and so it was that in her gentle heart there
was more of commiseration than anger.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were interrupted by Dick's announcement
that the stage was at the door. When Jean
came to bid her good-night she looked into the
strained, pathetic eyes with compassionate tenderness,
and a sudden impulse made her lean forward
and kiss the girl lovingly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>Once more the old stage rumbled over the road
between Hetherford and Crescent Beach. The wind
had veered a point to the east, and blew damp and
chill, driving before it a mist of clouds across the
sky, obscuring the moon's bright light. The sudden
change in the atmosphere was felt by everybody,
and the conversation was spasmodic, broken by long
intervals of silence. Jean, very white and still now
that the tension was relaxed, shrank back into her
corner clinging fast to Eleanor's hand. In a further
corner Farr sat at Helen's side, silent during the
whole of the long drive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XV.<br /><br />
HELEN IS PUZZLED.</h2>

<p class="p2">Miss Stuart's visit was drawing to a close, and
Nan was giving a luncheon in her honor. The
little parlor of the parsonage was redolent with the
fragrance of roses and mignonette, which were massed
in every vase and bowl, and the arrangement of the
simple, old-fashioned furniture bore evidence of Nan's
artistic taste. A few good etchings and a half-dozen
rare old prints adorned the walls, and scattered about
on the low mantel were several valuable bits of <i>vertu</i>.</p>

<p>Nan stood in the center of the room, and received
her guests with outstretched hand and beaming face.</p>

<p>"Now, I call this delightful," she said cheerily, as
she shook hands with Miss Stuart. "Even father
has gone away for the day, so we are a typical Hetherford
party&mdash;all girls and no men. Em said you
would be bored to death," she rattled on in a confidential
undertone, "but for once in a way I thought
you might find it amusing to have plenty of your
own sex. It is no novelty to us, as Em will tell you
with a face as long as the moral code."</p>

<p>"I think it is charming," Miss Stuart affirmed, with
a greater regard for amiability than for truth.</p>

<p>Nan smiled mischievously.</p>

<p>"Confess it is dull."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed it is not, Miss Nan. The imp of dullness
would never dare to show his surly face in your presence."</p>

<p>"Ah, you do not know," and Nan shook her head
in laughing protest. "Drop in here any Sunday between
church-time and dinner, and you will find us
boon companions."</p>

<p>The door into the dining-room was opened, and a
grim-visaged woman in a starched calico gown of uncompromising
stiffness appeared on the threshold.
For a moment she eyed Nan threateningly, and then
announced:</p>

<p>"Your lunch is on the table," and added, as she
faced about and marched back into the dining room,
"and it's getting cold."</p>

<p>Nan, in no wise disconcerted, turned a wry face toward
her guests:</p>

<p>"Biddy and I had one of our most deadly affrays
just before you arrived, so don't be surprised at anything
she may give us for luncheon. I tried, for your
sakes, to keep my temper until later in the day, but it
wouldn't be kept."</p>

<p>"It never will," sighed Emily ruefully, in the midst
of the general laugh.</p>

<p>Nan ushered them into the dining room:</p>

<p>"Miss Stuart, will you sit here on my right? Girls,
take any places you want."</p>

<p>"You needn't have worried about luncheon, Nan.
These biscuits are simply delicious," observed Helen,
consolingly, as Bridget vanished into the kitchen.
"Biddy is far too proud of her skill to disgrace
you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, she would not mind me," laughed Nan airily.
"Nothing would restrain her but her sense of importance,
and her undying jealousy of your cook."</p>

<p>"What a glorious time we had at the dance,"
Emily remarked irrelevantly. "It was about the
most successful thing we have done this summer. It
has made such a difference having the <i>Vortex</i> here,
hasn't it, Jean?"</p>

<p>Jean, thus addressed, changed color rapidly, and
then was furious with herself, for she caught Miss
Stuart's eyes fixed on her with insolent directness.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother the <i>Vortex</i>," cried Mollie petulantly.
"Don't let us talk about men. There are dozens of
subjects more interesting."</p>

<p>"We will make it 'man,' and talk of Dick. Eh,
Mollie?" and Nathalie laughed provokingly.</p>

<p>"We couldn't do better," responded Mollie imperturbably.
"Dick is lovely, is he not, Miss Stuart?"</p>

<p>Miss Stuart flung back her head with a merry laugh;
no whit embarrassed by the naïve question. Dick had
been her shadow for the past week, and was sighing
and pining like the most approved of lovers, yet she
answered with a nonchalance which Nathalie would
have given worlds to acquire.</p>

<p>"He is truly charming, Miss Mollie. I quite share
your enthusiasm."</p>

<p>Then she dropped out of the conversation, listening
with languid interest to the topics which the others
fell to discussing with much animation. Their views
of life differed materially from her own; their complete
unworldliness called a half-contemptuous smile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
to her lips, and yet there was awakened within her a
shadowy feeling of regret. She had lived a purely
pleasure-loving life, without a thought beyond her
own advancement along the line of her ambitions. To
a certain extent she had been eminently successful.
Her marvelous beauty, supplemented by a decided
mental ability, had strewn her path with the admiration
and adulation which she craved, and faults and
failings, which in a less beautiful woman would have
received harsh censure, were in her case overlooked
and condoned. To-day, for the first time, the thought
assailed her that perhaps she was the victim of an
erroneous idea; that perhaps these young girls, living
their lives so simply, actuated by a desire to act uprightly
and to be honest and affectionate in every
relationship in life, had found a happiness which had
eluded her grasp.</p>

<p>Nathalie, who vainly strove at times to be cynical,
made some careless remark, and Miss Stuart listened
wonderingly to a gentle remonstrance which Eleanor
administered in accents of earnestness.</p>

<p>"Ah! Nat, dear, don't say that, even in fun.
Everything makes a difference."</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes," added Helen.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"No stream from its source flows seaward,</p>
<p class="i1">How lonely soever its course,</p>
<p>But what some land is gladdened.</p>
<p class="i1">No star ever rose or set</p>
<p>Without influence somewhere."</p>
</div>

<p>She quoted the lines charmingly, despite the little
shyness which was so characteristic of her.</p>

<p>"I suppose that is true," said Mollie thoughtfully;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
"and in the large things in life we know that we can
only be in harmony with God's plan by acting absolutely
in accordance with our consciences. But it is
hard to realize the importance of our decision in regard
to the small daily occurrences. They seem almost
too insignificant to exert any influence, either
for good or evil."</p>

<p>"Influence does not lie only in deeds, Mollie,"
Eleanor replied, "either small or great. It seems to
me that it is what we are, not what we do, that is the
essential thing. If one's heart is pure and true, purity
and truth will be manifested in one's actions, however
trivial. And remember, dear, for I am going to quote
now:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"No life can be strong in its purpose and pure in its strife,</p>
<p>And all life not be stronger and purer thereby."</p>
</div>

<p>Jean gave her friend's hand an affectionate squeeze.</p>

<p>"I do believe you are the best girl living," she
whispered softly, with an air of profound conviction.</p>

<p>"You see, girls, what it is to have a friend like
Jean."</p>

<p>"You mean like Eleanor," Jean promptly retorted.</p>

<p>"I suppose that is true friendship," mused Mollie.</p>

<p>"Must friendship necessarily be as blind as love?"
queried Nan, with a smile at the two girls which
robbed the words of any sting.</p>

<p>"Jean knows nothing of love," declared Emily,
with an air of superiority which was eminently amusing.
It was common parlance that Emily never saw
the general aspect of things quite as clearly as most
people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>Jean joined somewhat constrainedly in the laugh
that greeted these words, and wondered if it could be
her imagination that Miss Stuart's smile held a covert
sneer.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Helen reached
the manor and made her way up to the nursery. The
room was dim, for heavy clouds shortened the summer
day. A sharp east wind moaned through the
trees outside, and nurse had wisely lighted a wood
fire in the wide chimneyplace. Its fitful flickering
light fell full on little Gladys kneeling before the
hearth, her eyes big with excitement as her chubby
hands shaped a wonderful house of blocks; while near
her Larry, lying flat on his back, threw out occasional
hints and suggestions as to its construction. Willie,
curled up in one of the deep window-seats, was making
the best of the fast-fading daylight to finish a
story which, to judge from his absorbed expression,
must have been of thrilling interest. As Helen
pushed open the door and advanced toward the
cheerful fire, three pairs of eyes looked up to greet
her.</p>

<p>"Well, chicks, you all look very happy and
comfie."</p>

<p>Gladys thrust out her hands in quick alarm to save
her block house from dangerous contact with the skirt
of Helen's gown.</p>

<p>"P'ease take care, sister," she lisped. "Don't step
on our b'ocks, 'cause Larry an' me is buildin' a big
castle."</p>

<p>"Baby, baby, 'Larry an' me is buildin'?'"</p>

<p>Gladys shook her fluffy head impatiently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't got any time to bovver. I'm velly
busy."</p>

<p>Helen laughed, and dropping down upon the floor,
began to lend a helping hand. Gladys sank back on
her heels with a complacent sigh.</p>

<p>"Build a booful one, sister, big as this," raising her
arms high over her head.</p>

<p>Helen nodded, but paused from her task, block in
hand, to give a glance at Willie.</p>

<p>"Put down your book, dearie," she said to him.
"This is the worst possible light to read in. You will
ruin your eyes."</p>

<p>Willie heaved a sigh as he closed the precious book
and, stretching himself after his cramped position,
rose slowly to his feet, and joined the group before
the fire. Flinging himself down near Helen, he laid
his head in her lap. She patted his little round face
affectionately, and went on with her castle-building.</p>

<p>The setting sun had broken through the clouds, and
a flood of yellow light streamed through the western
windows. From the huge logs in the fireplace an increasing
volume of flames roared up the chimney, its
ruddy glow illuminating the eager faces of the children,
intent on every movement of their sister's deft hands.
The truly wonderful house of blocks was nearing completion
when Jean came quietly into the room. For
a moment she stood silent in the shadowy doorway
contemplating the pretty scene with wistful eyes. As
she approached more nearly she unconsciously echoed
Helen's words of a few moments past.</p>

<p>"Well, you look very happy, all of you."</p>

<p>Helen laughed softly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>"This is an exciting moment, Jeanie, so you must
not marvel if we are not very talkative."</p>

<p>Jean leaned against one side of the old-fashioned
chimneyplace, and absently watched the placing of
the last few blocks.</p>

<p>"Gladys," she whispered, after a moment, "what do
you think I saw just now?"</p>

<p>"What, Jeanie?" lifting her flushed face to her
sister's.</p>

<p>"Mary on her way upstairs with your supper, and
oh, what cookies!"</p>

<p>"Goody!" cried Larry, springing to his feet with a
bound which brought the beautiful castle tumbling to
the ground.</p>

<p>"You naughty boy!" scolded Gladys crossly.
"See what you done!"</p>

<p>Jean took the angry, pouting little face between
her hands, and smiled tenderly down into the tearful
eyes:</p>

<p>"It is hard luck, baby, but you might as well get
used to having your castles demolished."</p>

<p>"It's a shame," grumbled Willie, who was almost as
disappointed as his little sister. "Larry's always
rough."</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," interrupted Helen, rising from
the floor. "I am sure Larry didn't mean to upset the
house, and in any case we could not leave it in Mary's
way."</p>

<p>"Bother Mary."</p>

<p>"Hush, Willie, you must not speak so. Now run
away and dress for dinner. Larry and Gladys must
have their supper."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>Jean followed her sister out into the hall, and laid
a detaining hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Helen," she said, very low, "are you ever really
unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, Jean, sometimes. But why do you ask?
Surely you are always in good spirits."</p>

<p>Jean smiled a little bitterly:</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I am, and I suppose I must go on
fulfilling my destiny until the end of the chapter. But
even if one has a reputation for unending hilarity,
there are times&mdash;&mdash;" She broke off abruptly with a
laugh which suggested tears, and rushed away in the
direction of her room, leaving Helen sorely puzzled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XVI.<br /><br />
"IT WAS ONLY MY IMAGINATION."</h2>

<p class="p2">"May I come in, Aunt Helen?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear." Aunt Helen looked up
from the open Bible on her knee, and welcomed Jean
with a cheery smile. "Where were you all yesterday?
I did not have a glimpse of you."</p>

<p>The girl crossed the room, and dropping down into
an easy-chair near the open window, gazed listlessly
out across the sunlit lawn.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was just here as usual."</p>

<p>Aunt Helen closed her Bible and laid it carefully
down on the table.</p>

<p>"Are you tired already of so much pleasuring,
Jeanie?"</p>

<p>"I don't see that we have had a great deal of
pleasuring lately," her niece replied perversely. "I
think Hetherford is the stupidest place in the world,
and I am tired of everything."</p>

<p>Aunt Helen was far too wise to remonstrate just
then. After a moment's silence, she opened a subject
which had never failed to awaken an interest in Jean.</p>

<p>"I had a nice letter from Mrs. Appleton to-day.
They seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves now,
and she says Guy is working splendidly and expects
to accomplish great things on his return."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," was Jean's inattentive response, as her eyes
marked the circling of a buzzing fly outside the
window.</p>

<p>"Miss Stuart is making quite a long visit," ventured
Aunt Helen patiently. "I had thought that
she would soon tire of Hetherford."</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't see why she doesn't go away.
The whole house is turned upside down to provide
her with amusement. It is a perfect bore."</p>

<p>"My dear," Aunt Helen objected, "that is surely
not the spirit of true hospitality. We do not speak ill
of our guests. <i>Noblesse oblige.</i>"</p>

<p>"I can't help it," and Jean, now thoroughly aroused,
started up from her chair; "I am not going to pretend
to like a person when I don't. She is insufferably
patronizing, and I hate her."</p>

<p>Aunt Helen looked up at her niece with real distress
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, child," and she held out her hand, "come
here. I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>Jean stood irresolute, looking half ashamed, and
wholly miserable. At that most inopportune moment
Nathalie flung open the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are, Jean. I have been looking all
over for you. Come on down and have a game of
tennis before dinner. Why, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>Jean hastily averted her face.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I don't care to play tennis."</p>

<p>"Oh, please do, I am just in the humor for it."</p>

<p>"You may be, but I am not," Jean returned curtly.</p>

<p>"What in the world has come over you?" asked
Nathalie bluntly. "I never knew anyone's disposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
to become as uncertain and irritable as yours has
lately."</p>

<p>"Why don't you let me alone, then? My temper
may be growing bad, but yours has never been anything
else."</p>

<p>Nathalie shrugged her shoulders, and laughing
shortly, went on her way without another word.</p>

<p>When the door had closed on her, Jean slipped
down on the floor and, burying her face in Aunt
Helen's lap, sobbed convulsively.</p>

<p>"I don't know what is the matter with me," she
faltered. "I am so cross and irritable lately.
Everything seems to set my nerves on edge. I never
used to feel so."</p>

<p>Aunt Helen passed her thin hand soothingly over
the girl's bent head.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, dearie. Of course you did
not mean to speak so. You are tired and unstrung
to-day."</p>

<p>By and by Jean's sobs grew less frequent, then
ceased altogether. She lifted her head, and, resting
her arm on Aunt Helen's knee, dropped her chin in
her hand, and stared absently before her. All trace
of emotion had left her face, and it now wore an expression
of utter weariness and dejection. Her aunt
looked thoughtfully down at her. Had it been either
Helen or Nathalie who had thus given way it would
not have troubled her, but proud little Jean was too
reserved and self-contained to break down unless she
had been very sorely tried. The silence had lasted
some few moments when Aunt Helen again spoke.</p>

<p>"In spite of your denial, Jean, I fear that your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
playtime has lasted too long. Discontent never fails
to creep in among us when we are idle. You see,
dear, I am taking it for granted that it is nothing
deeper than a feeling of discontent which makes you
so unhappy. I know of nothing else unless&mdash;&mdash;" She
paused. Jean stirred uneasily under her direct
glance. Aunt Helen instantly averted her eyes, and
resumed: "I am sorry that my ill health forces me
to lead my life so apart from you all. I am in
ignorance of the many currents and eddies which
would otherwise be apparent to me, but if ever you
need my advice you know how gladly I will give it
to you, and there are times when an old head is
better than a young one."</p>

<p>Still Jean did not speak. Aunt Helen sighed a
little sadly:</p>

<p>"Well, my child, I suppose I am mistaken, and
that your trouble is only a surfeit of pleasure."</p>

<p>"I am a great baby, Auntie, but I am glad I came
here to you to have my cry out. You always help
me so, and make me ashamed of being so impatient,"
and Jean looked lovingly up into the worn face which
was bent above her.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dearie. You must come to me whenever
you feel discouraged and unhappy, and remember
I always stand ready to give you whatever comfort
or counsel lies within my power. But, Jean," and
her voice was very grave, "I have learned from my
own experience, both of petty annoyance and of great
trials, that there is only one true source of strength."</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>At a late hour that night Lillian Stuart sat before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
the low dressing-table in her cozy room, reviewing
the events of the past week. The face which the
mirror reflected was clouded, the eyes somber and
full of fire, for the consciousness of defeat was upon
her. As yet, however, no thought of capitulation occurred
to her. Farr's indifference, his evident love
for another, but deepened her love for him, stinging
it into a passion that was well-nigh overmastering her.
The difficulties in her path lent new zest to the struggle,
rousing within her heart an insatiable desire for conquest.
Possession had ever palled upon her. She
had loved Farr, but as an accepted lover he had
wearied her, and her love for him was not strong
enough to drown the voice of worldly wisdom and
prudence. To be sure, in those days he was hardly
more than a boy, poor and unknown, whereas to-day
he was a man well versed in the world's ways, liberally
supplied with the world's goods, and with the respect
and esteem of his fellow-men, yet preserving
the same sweet, magnetic personality which long ago
had made such a deep impression on her somewhat
fickle heart. These considerations naturally had
weight with her, but the secret of her determination
lay not in these, but in the obstacles to be surmounted,
the flattering assurance that her power could not be
foiled. Had she been quite honest with herself she
must have acknowledged that once the victory gained
the charm would be forever broken. As Farr's wife
she would be a thoroughly wretched woman. Knowing
full well his hatred of an untruth, his contempt
for a deception, his passionate anger at an injustice,
did she not dream what a death to his soul a union
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
with her would have been? Alas! she herself had
revealed to him the shallowness of her nature, the
pettiness of her ambitions, the faithlessness of her
heart. The lesson was a bitter one but he had
learned it well, and, deep in her soul, Lillian Stuart
knew that never again would he give his love unworthily.
She hated Jean Lawrence, yet she appreciated
her purity and gentleness, the fineness of her
nature, the almost exalted bent of her mind. But
this appreciation did not soften her heart, nor weaken
her determination. Jean had balked her, and Jean
must suffer.</p>

<p>The face in the mirror before her grew hard; there
were rigid lines about the mouth, the wonderful eyes
gleamed strangely bright.</p>

<p>"I love him. I have always loved him. She shall
not have him. It is the one satisfaction that is left
me if all else fails."</p>

<p>Sharp upon these thoughts came a tap upon the
door, and Helen Lawrence entered. A soft wrapper
enveloped her slender frame, and her hair hung loose
upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I wanted to come in for a little chat, Lillian. Do
you mind if I braid my hair here?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, indeed. I am glad to have you. Sit
down."</p>

<p>Helen drew a chair up close to the dressing-table,
and seating herself, began slowly to plait her long
soft hair. She put aside some light topic which Miss
Stuart suggested, and spoke at once of the subject
which lay nearest her heart.</p>

<p>"I am worried about Jean, Lillian. She does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
seem like herself lately, and if it were not absurd, I
should begin to think she was unhappy about something."</p>

<p>"Indeed." The response was so brief as to be
almost an ejaculation. Helen's words accorded
strangely with Miss Stuart's thoughts.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you don't know how unusual it is for
Jean to be either irritable or moody. She has a very
bright, sunny nature, and is particularly sweet-tempered."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is something troubling her which
you have not perceived."</p>

<p>Helen wrinkled her forehead thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I am afraid there must be."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart darted a swift glance at her.</p>

<p>"Have you ever thought what it might be?"</p>

<p>Helen's attention was caught by a certain tone in
her friend's voice. She raised her eyes questioningly:</p>

<p>"No, dear; I wish I had a clew."</p>

<p>"Suppose I should give you one?"</p>

<p>There was genuine surprise in Helen's face. She
answered with a tenderness in her voice which gave
her companion a pang.</p>

<p>"Why, Lillian, do you know of anything to make
Jean unhappy?"</p>

<p>Miss Stuart lifted her head as if to strengthen her
purpose, wondering at the sudden weakness in herself
which made the words so hard to say:</p>

<p>"Your sister is in love with Mr. Farr."</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Helen, staring blankly at her friend.</p>

<p>"I only wonder you have not seen it before,"
added Miss Stuart coolly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you think he is in love with her?" blundered
Helen, who had not sufficiently recovered from her
astonishment to be very wise in Jean's behalf.</p>

<p>The answer was incisive:</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>The hot tears rushed to Helen's eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor little Jean!"</p>

<p>Miss Stuart turned away and, to save herself, spoke
harshly:</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Helen, don't cry. It is such a
weak thing to do."</p>

<p>The sharp words brought Helen suddenly to a realization
of what she had done in thus accepting, without
demur, Miss Stuart's statement in regard to Jean.
Too late she remembered that it was little short of disloyalty
to discuss the subject with an outsider; an
outsider, moreover, who had never made any pretense
of liking her sister. She resolved to retrieve herself
if possible, and answered not a little proudly:</p>

<p>"I am sorry I offended you, Lillian. We often
differ in our opinions as to what is weak and what is
not."</p>

<p>"Not often, but always," Lillian broke in with a
disagreeable laugh.</p>

<p>"Where I was weak," continued Helen, ignoring utterly
the interruption, "was, in laying too much stress
on your verdict in regard to my sister. I am not
authorized to contradict your statement, but I think it is
more than probable that your perceptions have been at
fault. In regard to Mr. Farr, he has certainly seemed
to both like and admire Jean. Once or twice I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
even thought him very much concerned about her.
Why, at the dance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I imagine, my dear, that your perceptions are
equally as faulty as my own. It may interest you to
learn that Mr. Farr and I were at one time engaged;
that he loved me madly, and that my breaking of the
engagement was a terrible blow to him. It is possible,
however, since in your opinion Mr. Farr has transferred
his affections from me to your sister, that he has
already confessed this to her." The taunting words
were spoken lightly, but Miss Stuart's eyes searched
Helen's face. What she saw there must have satisfied
her, for she turned aside with an air of relief.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, which was broken by a
question from Helen:</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Farr still care for you, Lillian?"</p>

<p>The clear truthful eyes met Miss Stuart's squarely,
and under their steady gaze she moved restively. It
was not easy to tell a direct lie to Helen. She bent
her head, and a slow flush mounted to her face.</p>

<p>"That is hardly fair, Helen. He certainly has not
told me of any change in his feeling toward me." She
flung back her head and her lustrous eyes held a
challenge. "You have seen him with me. What do
you think?"</p>

<p>Her face was alight with power and magnetism;
the scarlet lips were slightly parted, as the breath came
hurriedly through them; one firm white hand on her
breast held together the loose folds of her dressing-gown,
which fell about her superb figure in long, graceful
lines. At that moment she was regal, majestic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>Helen gazed at her steadfastly, and her heart sank.</p>

<p>"Poor little Jean," she thought hopelessly. "What
could she do?"</p>

<p>For Helen, as was her wont, laid too much stress
upon her friend's great beauty of face and form, and
overlooked the deeper beauty of her sister's soul.</p>

<p>As she crept into bed that night she murmured to
herself:</p>

<p>"I must warn Jean, gently and lovingly. God
grant it may not be too late."</p>

<p>Her opportunity came the very next evening, for
directly dinner was finished Nathalie and Miss Stuart
started off on a long-planned ride with Churchill and
Andrews. Jean stood on the veranda to watch them
mount and ride away. Her eyes followed them until
their four figures, swaying slightly with the motion of
the horses, were no longer silhouetted against the
evening sky, then descended the broad flight of steps,
and wandered out into the garden. The sun had already
set, but the earth was still wrapped in the mystic
light of the purple after-glow. Once in the sweet
old-fashioned garden Jean paced slowly up and down
the trim paths, bordered by rows of fragrant mignonette
and carnations, and flanked at the corners by
tall hollyhocks and slender poppies, and into her sad
heart stole something of the peace and quiet of the
tranquil spot.</p>

<p>"It is all so strange and incomprehensible," ran
her thoughts, "but I am not going to worry about it.
There must be some mistake somewhere. I believed
in him so implicitly. I felt so sure of his love&mdash;oh,
I cannot, I will not believe that he deliberately deceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
me. If only he were here now, while she is
away, I am sure that everything could be explained.
Oh, he might come&mdash;he might be honest with me!"</p>

<p>The garden gate clicked, and she looked up with
startled eyes; but it was only Helen coming down
the path to meet her.</p>

<p>"Why did you run away?" her sister asked as she
linked her arm in hers.</p>

<p>"I didn't run very fast," smiled Jean. "I sauntered
out when the girls started off for their ride.
It is so restful here," she added in a lower tone.</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound one bit like you, Jean," said
Helen slowly. "I am afraid something must be
troubling you, if you feel the need of a restful place
where you can be alone."</p>

<p>Jean laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"Why, what an absurd idea, Helen. Why should
I be unhappy?"</p>

<p>"That is just what I don't know, dear, but I think
you are."</p>

<p>"Well, what if I am?" cried Jean, brought to bay.
"One cannot always be perfectly contented and happy;
I do not suppose that I am to be any more exempt
than other people."</p>

<p>Helen's eyes were bent on the ground, and she
spoke with some hesitation.</p>

<p>"Of course that is true enough, but there is usually
some definite cause for unhappiness. I don't want
to be impertinent, Jean, but is there not some one
thing weighing on you at present? Has&mdash;" She
paused, then went on desperately&mdash;"has Mr. Farr
anything to do with it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>She felt the violent start that Jean gave, heard the
sharp indrawing of her breath, and she did not dare
to raise her eyes to her sister's face for fear of reading
there still further confirmation of her surmises. She
had need of all her courage yet to deal the cruel blow,
and without pausing for breath, she hurried on. Her
words were confused, incoherent, but they struck a
chill as of death to Jean's tender heart.</p>

<p>"It was only a foolish idea of mine, Jeanie. Of
course there is no truth in it&mdash;there can't be&mdash;there
must not be. He&mdash;that is, I have just discovered
that he is deeply in love with Lillian. They have
been engaged, and I fear the engagement is about
to be renewed. Why, darling, he is not worthy of a
thought of yours. Forget him, Jean, darling. It is
only your imagination." Her voice choked, and she
ended abruptly.</p>

<p>For an instant not a sound broke the stillness, then
Jean faced her sister with strained, wide-open eyes,
and spoke to her in a voice that was quite steady, but
curiously dull and unnatural.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you have told me of this, Helen.
Now that I think of it I am not greatly surprised.
You need not worry about me. I am all right."</p>

<p>They had ceased from their walking to and fro, and
as they stood thus opposite each other Jean swayed a
little. Helen flung both arms around her.</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, what is it? Speak to me. It is only
Helen. I love you so, dear."</p>

<p>Jean suffered the embrace, but there was no responsive
yielding in the slender, rigid figure. When
Helen released her she drew away, and started toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the gate. Helen did not stir, and when Jean had
gone a few steps she paused and turned her white,
stricken face toward her sister.</p>

<p>"You need not worry about me," she repeated, "I
am all right." And then, with a pathetic outstretching
of her hands, she added: "It was only my imagination."</p>

<p>Helen sprang forward, but Jean waved her back,
and in another moment the shadows of the gloaming
hid the flitting figure from Helen's tearful eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XVII.<br /><br />
THE "VORTEX" DEPARTS.</h2>

<p class="p2">"Let fall! Give way!"</p>

<p>Two oars struck the water with a splash, and
the dingey shot out from the gang steps of the <i>Sylph</i>
the steady strokes of two sturdy sailors sending the
little craft swiftly on its way. The owner lounged
lazily in the cushioned stern, one leg swung over the
other, the tiller-ropes held loosely in his hands. They
were sweeping under the stern of the <i>Vortex</i> when
a voice from the schooner's deck hailed them. The
sailors held their oars suspended, and Churchill
pushed back his cap and looked up, frowning slightly,
for the sun was in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hello, Farr."</p>

<p>"Hello, old man. Going ashore?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Want a lift?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, if you don't mind putting back."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it."</p>

<p>The orders were given, and the dingey brought up
to the gang steps. Farr sprang in and they pushed
off, heading once more for land.</p>

<p>Churchill pulled a cigar-case from his pocket and
held it out to his companion, and then a brief silence
ensued while each procured a light.</p>

<p>"You've been something of a recluse for the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
few days, Farr; I haven't seen you about. Been sticking
close to your quarters?"</p>

<p>"I've been grinding at the charts. Our stay here
is about at an end, and Dodd is a little dissatisfied
with the progress of our work. Through one cause
and another we have been delayed, and the work has
dragged."</p>

<p>"That doesn't seem to concern Dudley at all.
He's ashore most of the time."</p>

<p>Farr laughed indulgently.</p>

<p>"Oh! Dudley's a lazy Southerner. You can't
hustle him. He's the salt of the earth, when you have
plenty of time; but you can't impress him with the
necessity of haste."</p>

<p>"When do you go, old man?"</p>

<p>Farr took his cigar from between his lips, and
watched the cloud of smoke as the breeze bore it far
astern.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly," he answered slowly.
"Within the next week or ten days surely."</p>

<p>"You will be very much missed," said Churchill
heartily; "yet I suppose it has been slow work for
you."</p>

<p>Farr looked contemplatively down at the lighted
end of his cigar.</p>

<p>"No. I shall be sorry to go."</p>

<p>After a slight pause he added:</p>

<p>"What has been going on?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. Andrews has gone up to town.
Miss Stuart is still at the manor; but, of course, that
is no news to you."</p>

<p>"I imagined she had not left," returned Farr indifferently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
"I am going to call there this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Suppose, then, you meet me here; say in a couple
of hours," suggested Churchill, as he brought the
dingey up to the float, "and go out and dine with me
aboard the <i>Sylph</i>. I am by myself, for Andrews is
away, and Archer is engaged."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I will be delighted."</p>

<p>Churchill turned to the sailor who stood erect in
the boat, awaiting his orders.</p>

<p>"At six sharp, Petersen, and tell the steward there
will be two for dinner."</p>

<p>Then the two men turned on their heels and strode
briskly up the sandy road. Presently their paths diverged,
and with a friendly nod they separated.</p>

<p>Farr went along in the direction of the manor at a
swinging gait. He had not seen Jean since the night
of the dance. In the events of that evening his love
for her had sustained a severe shock. He could not
at once readjust himself to this new and unwelcome
development in the nature of her to whom he had
given his deepest and most loyal allegiance. Heretofore
he had found his love for her intensified by
her coldness and indifference, but her flirtation with
Maynard was not the sort of thing he had expected
from her, and it disappointed him bitterly. The
world condoned many of Maynard's offenses because
he possessed a certain charm and amiability of manner,
but Farr was too clean-minded and upright to
look lightly upon the man's selfish disregard of every
moral obligation, and he was impatient of his ill-deserved
popularity. That Jean should show this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
man so marked a preference was to him incomprehensible.
It was possible that she did not know the full
truth in regard to him, but even her innocence and
unworldliness could not altogether shield her from
blame, for she did know that he was a faithless husband,
and, moreover, his wife was her friend. Under
any other circumstances Farr would have been jealous,
but now the sharpness of his disappointment in
Jean outweighed every other consideration. She had
been to him the embodiment of sweetness and purity,
and as he paced up and down the white decks of the
<i>Vortex</i>, he inveighed bitterly against this second overthrow
of his faith. His anger was short-lived, however,
for the tender little Jean of the early summer
had twined herself closely about his heart; and now
she rose, strong in the power and might of her love,
denying valiantly that other self, pleading earnestly
for more confidence and trust. So it happened this
sunshiny day that, as Farr leaned against the rail,
gazing seaward, and pondered on these strange and
contradictory events, suddenly the bitterness died out
of his heart, and in its place sprang up a passionate
longing to see Jean, to hear her sweet voice tell him
it was all a mistake, to put an end forever to this
intolerable uncertainty. And even as he came to this
conclusion, the dingey from the <i>Sylph</i> hove in view,
and, without pausing to reconsider, he hailed it.</p>

<p>Now he had left the manor gates behind, and striking
out across the lawn, increased his pace, for his
impatience would not be curbed. The crunching
sound of wheels on the gravel brought him to a standstill.
On his right a clump of cedars hid the road
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
from sight. He thrust aside the low-growing branches,
and as he peered through the aperture a carriage
flashed by. Jean was driving, and he had a tantalizing
glimpse of her bonny face, as she turned to speak
to Eleanor and Cliff, who were on the back seat. An
involuntary exclamation escaped him, and he sprang
forward, but his voice was unheard, his presence unheeded,
and with a heavy heart he gazed after the
rapidly retreating vehicle. With a savage little laugh
he swung about, and retraced his steps. The joyousness
of the summer day was darkened for him, and in
his heart was a fierce resentment against Fate.</p>

<p>His eyes were bent upon the ground as he plodded
slowly along the road, and so he did not see Miss
Stuart, driving alone in Helen's buckboard, until she
was within a few yards of him.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart scanned his face furtively as he stood
beside the carriage.</p>

<p>"Ah, Val," she said with an assumption of ease,
"I suppose you have been at the manor?"</p>

<p>"No, I met them driving."</p>

<p>"How inhospitable of them not to have turned
back," she exclaimed, with her eyes still on his
face.</p>

<p>Farr was too obtuse to appreciate the drift of her
remark.</p>

<p>"I was unfortunate. They did not see me."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart's brows contracted in a frown, and she
flicked the long lash of her whip.</p>

<p>"You are not flattering, Val. I was at home."</p>

<p>He looked up at her quickly, a vague surprise in his
eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>"I would not venture to inflict myself on you!"
he replied with a careless laugh, and then he stood
back a step, and raised his hat.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart's face flushed angrily, but she had no
alternative but to drive on. As she gathered up the
reins she shot a glance over her shoulder at Farr, but
already he had turned away, and was moving rapidly
down the road. She cut the horse with the whip, and
in her heart was a burning desire to revenge herself
on Jean.</p>

<p>As they took their places about the dinner-table at
the manor that evening, Nathalie made some casual
mention of the <i>Vortex</i>, thus giving Miss Stuart the
pretext she sought.</p>

<p>"By the way," she said, fixing her eyes on Jean's
face, although her words were addressed to Helen,
"on my way home this afternoon after I left you, I
met Mr. Farr and had such a pleasant chat with him.
He was on his way to call on us, but as he met me, I
suppose&mdash;&mdash;" She broke off with a charming air of
embarrassment.</p>

<p>Jean raised her head proudly, and met Miss Stuart's
gaze with unflinching eyes.</p>

<p>"You should have brought Mr. Farr back to tea,"
she said, so unconcernedly that even Helen was deceived,
and Miss Stuart was stirred with a passing
feeling of admiration.</p>

<p>But the effort cost Jean a pang, and as she turned
her eyes slowly away, there was a great coldness at her
heart.</p>

<p>The following afternoon the girls were having tea
in the drawing-room, the long French windows were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
pushed wide open, and the soft west wind moved the
curtains gently to and fro. The blinds were drawn,
for the sun shone hotly, and the half-darkened room
seemed deliciously cool and refreshing, after the
sultry atmosphere of the outer world.</p>

<p>Little Gladys danced in from the hall-way, waving
a letter in the air.</p>

<p>"I took it away from Susie, sister," she cried, in
her clear, childish treble. "I don't know who it's
for."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart leaned forward in her chair, and
caught the soft dimpled wrist in her firm white hand.</p>

<p>"Let me read the address for you, baby."</p>

<p>Gladys demurred, shaking her fluffy head, her blue
eyes full of laughter, but Miss Stuart quietly possessed
herself of the letter.</p>

<p>Her face fell as she turned toward the light and
read the address. The handwriting, familiar, yet
half strange, awakened a host of memories within
her; but the written name was not the one she had
been wont to see. She read the address aloud, with
a tinge of sarcasm in her smooth voice:</p>

<p>"'Miss Jean Lawrence, The Manor House.' For
you, Miss Jean."</p>

<p>Jean crossed the room and took the envelope from
Miss Stuart's hand. She could not repress a faint
start of surprise as her eyes fell upon the superscription,
but the scornful smile on Miss Stuart's lips lent
her instant self-control. She slipped the letter into
her pocket, and resuming her place at Eleanor's side,
took up the thread of the conversation where it had
been broken off, with apparent ease and facility. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
her heart was beating wildly, and the hand that held
the dainty teacup was far from steady.</p>

<p>It was almost an hour later when she pushed aside
the portières, and entered the music room. She
glanced about her anxiously to assure herself that she
was alone, then crossing to the further end and ensconsing
herself in one of the deep window-seats,
pulled the letter from her pocket. For an instant she
held it in her hand, her brows drawn together, a wistful,
questioning look in her eyes. She was forcing
herself to recall every word that Helen had said
to her that miserable evening in the garden. In the
light of that talk, this letter to her from Valentine
Farr both puzzled and troubled her. She looked
down at the address, and with a sudden light of determination
in her face, broke the seal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Jean:</span></p>

<p>We have received our orders and leave Hetherford on Thursday.
Will you not let me see you before we sail? I started for the
manor yesterday, but from a distance saw you driving away. I
seem to be most unfortunate, but I cannot turn my back on the
place where I have found so much happiness, without an attempt
to see you again, to assure myself, at least, that I carry with me
your friendship and good will. You were very good to me in the
early days of our sojourn here, Miss Jean, and in memory of those
days I venture to ask you if I may call at the manor to-morrow
about four o'clock.</p>

<p class="left45">
Yours,<br />
<span class="smcap i7">Valentine Farr</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Once, twice Jean read it through, then mechanically
folded the bit of paper, and fitted it into the envelope
carefully. A tremulous, incredulous joy was dawning
on her face. She felt oppressed, and started to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
feet. It surprised her to find that she was trembling
so she could not stand. She laughed, a little hysterically,
as she sank back on the window-seat. Then,
suddenly, she flung out her hands, and slipping down
on her knees, buried her face in the soft cushions, and
a storm of weeping shook the slender figure. In her
despair she had been silent, tearless, but in this
awakening of hope within her, her pent-up feelings
found relief in tears. A wild, almost unreasonable, joy
was growing in her heart, and her quivering lips were
pressed passionately to her lover's letter. Her faith
in him, which Helen's words had so cruelly crushed,
was fast springing into life again.</p>

<p>When at length the strength of her emotion had
worn itself away, she lifted her head and, rising
slowly to her feet, leaned against the casement,
and looked thoughtfully out upon the peaceful
scene. The sun was setting, and the western horizon
was one blaze of golden glory. Jean's grave
eyes seemed asking counsel of the far illumined
sky. Once a deep sigh trembled through her lips,
and the thought that prompted it almost formed
itself in words.</p>

<p>"Oh, if only my mother were here! I could not
ask advice of anyone else, but I think I could speak
to her."</p>

<p>For a long time Jean stood there silent, motionless;
and when at last she moved away the crimson light
had quite faded, and a soft violet haze lingered in the
western sky. She crossed the room, and seated herself
at the open desk. For a moment she hesitated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
holding her pen poised above the sheet of paper, then
bent her head, and wrote rapidly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Farr:</span></p>

<p>I shall be at home to-morrow afternoon, and shall be very glad
to see you. I am sorry to learn that you are about to leave Hetherford,
and somewhat surprised also, as I had no idea that your
departure was imminent.</p>

<p class="left45">
Yours very sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap i7">Jean Lawrence.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The written words looked cold and formal, and
with a tender feeling of compunction Jean raised the
bit of paper to her lips.</p>

<p>"I would be more kind, dear, if I dared," she
murmured softly.</p>

<p>The old Dutch clock in the corner of the hall-way
was chiming the hour of three the following afternoon,
when Jean opened the door of her room, and started
to descend the wide staircase. From below voices
floated up to her, and when she reached the landing
she paused and, leaning over the banisters, looked
down upon the girls who were standing near the open
front door. Nathalie caught sight of her, and smiled
blithely.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to come with us, Jean? We are
going over to the inn for a game of tennis."</p>

<p>Jean shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am going to be thoroughly domestic this afternoon,"
she announced with a conscious little laugh.</p>

<p>At the sound of her voice Miss Stuart glanced
sharply over her shoulder. There flashed into her
mind the recollection of Farr's note to Jean the previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
day. She closed her lips tightly as she followed
Helen and Nathalie out upon the veranda, and was
singularly silent as they sauntered leisurely across the
lawn. When they were almost at the gates, she
turned to Helen, a distressed expression on her
lovely face.</p>

<p>"Would you mind very much if I should turn back?
I have had a slight headache all day, and the sun
seems to make it so much worse."</p>

<p>Helen looked sympathetically around at her.</p>

<p>"Why no, indeed, dear. I was afraid you were not
feeling well, you have been so quiet. By all means
let us go right back."</p>

<p>But Miss Stuart would not listen to such an arrangement,
and declared, with quite the air of a martyr, that
she should proceed to the inn, in spite of her headache,
unless Helen would do as she desired. When
at last she had succeeded in ridding herself of her
companions, she drew a deep breath, and turning,
walked hurriedly up the avenue. She did not quite
see her way clear to prevent an interview between
Farr and Jean, but she felt that if she were near at
hand, fortune might throw some unlooked-for chance
into her path. She had kept them apart so far.
Surely she must not fail now at the very end, for the
news of the <i>Vortex's</i> departure had been spread abroad
by Dudley with loud lamentations.</p>

<p>A great stillness lay over the manor this warm August
afternoon, and as she ascended the veranda steps
she heard clearly Aunt Helen's soft voice calling to
Jean from the floor above.</p>

<p>"My dear, will you not come up and read to me for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
a while? My eyes are troubling me so, I dare not use
them any more."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart stood still and listened, as Jean came
slowly out from the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Very well, Auntie," the girl responded half-heartedly,
and with an impatient sigh started up the
stairs.</p>
<p>
Miss Stuart waited a moment, then crossed the
veranda noiselessly, and entered the house. After a
cautious glance about the drawing-room, she stationed
herself in one of the front windows which commanded
the approach to the manor. The blinds were drawn
to shut out the heat and glare, and she turned the
slats slightly to afford a view of the driveway. A faint
breeze rustled the vines that trailed over the veranda
rail and climbed the graceful columns. The moments
dragged slowly by. Even Miss Stuart's active mind
began at length to yield itself to the drowsy influence
of the lifeless atmosphere, the monotonous buzzing of
the flies, and the lazy twittering of the birds as they
rested idly on the branches of the elms, or sailed
languidly through the haze which softly enveloped the
earth. She flung one arm above her head, and leaned
back in her chair. Her thoughts went back to those
far-off happy days in Annapolis, and a faint smile
curved the lines of her mouth. Dreamily her memories
journeyed on toward the present, and then once
more her jealous wrath was awakened. She started
up the more effectually to shake off the torpor that
was stealing over her, and, rising, took one or two
short turns up and down the room, pausing frequently
at her post, to peer out through the drawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
blinds. Her vigil was a tedious one, the result of
it uncertain, but the warring spirit within her was
now thoroughly aroused and her patience did not
flag.</p>

<p>"What move can I make?" she asked herself
again and again. "I can't very well insist on playing
an unwelcome third to their <i>tête-à-tête</i>. They
have been driven, and they would outwit me there.
Ah! well, we shall see, we shall see."</p>

<p>Then a sharp exclamation broke from her, for, as
she halted at the window, she discovered Valentine
Farr's erect figure swinging lightly across the lawn in
the direction of the manor. She turned the slats softly
and crossed hurriedly to the entrance of the drawing-room,
and standing there, her hands holding the
portières apart on either side, she tilted her head forward,
straining every nerve to catch the faintest
sound from the floor above. It was perfectly quiet,
and her face cleared a little. Next her anxious eyes
swept the half-darkened hall-way, as if in search of
some suggestion, but the wide chimney-place with its
brass andirons agleam where the light touched them,
the old clock in the corner ticking slowly, steadily,
offered her no help. The outer door stood ajar, and
leaning a little further forward she could see that
Farr was within a short distance of the veranda. Ah!
what should she do? Her quick ear caught the
sound of a heavy footfall ascending from the lower
floor and while her eyes were riveted on the spot
whence the sound issued, the swinging door in the
rear of the hall was pushed open, and a woman
toiled laboriously through, bearing in her arms a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
hamper of clean linen. Miss Stuart's ready mind
sprang at once to the solution of the difficulty, and
while the thought formed itself, she cleared the distance
between them.</p>

<p>Her voice shook a little as she spoke, for her heart
was beating high in the hope of victory.</p>

<p>"Please set your hamper right down here, and go
to the front door. There is a gentleman just coming
in. Say to him that Miss Jean begs to be excused,
that she particularly wishes to be excused. Well,"
imperiously, for the good-natured woman was
staring at her stupidly, with gaping mouth and astonished
eyes. "Don't you understand me? Put your
hamper down at once and do as I tell you."</p>

<p>The woman obeyed her slowly, and wiping her
hands on her apron, moved clumsily forward. Farr's
foot was already on the step of the veranda, and Miss
Stuart had barely time to push open the swinging
door and conceal herself behind it, when his clear,
quiet voice, addressing the strange servant, broke the
stillness.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell Miss Jean Lawrence that Mr.
Farr wishes to see her. She is expecting me, I believe."</p>

<p>The woman confused by her hurried orders, and
embarrassed by the unusual duty of waiting upon the
door, grew very red in the face, as she answered
bluntly:</p>

<p>"She says she won't see yer, sir."</p>

<p>Farr stared blankly at her.</p>

<p>"What? Oh, I think you must be mistaken. Just
take my message up to Miss Jean, please."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>In her hiding-place Miss Stuart clutched tightly at
the folds of her gown, and a look of desperation
burned in her eyes. But her fears were unfounded.
The woman's thickset figure barred the doorway, and
she stood her ground stolidly.</p>

<p>"It ain't no use, sir. She told me herself she pertick'ly
wouldn't see you, sir."</p>

<p>Farr's face went very white, and without another
syllable he turned on his heel and strode away.</p>

<p>"Sure I didn't say it just the same way yer told
me, Miss," the woman said apologetically, as Miss
Stuart opened the backdoor and confronted her,
"but I sent him away for yer, well enough, I guess,"
and grinning broadly, she lifted her hamper, and proceeded
heavily up the stairs.</p>

<p>A moment later Miss Stuart quietly followed her,
congratulating herself on the wonderful success of
her maneuver.</p>

<p>"It was a master-stroke," she said to herself triumphantly,
as she closed the door of her room.
"Susie will never know that he called, for I don't
believe that stupid creature will mention the occurrence.
Ah, how fortunate Mrs. Dennis's room is at
the rear of the house," and she flung herself down on
the lounge and closed her eyes wearily, for the excitement
had worn upon her.</p>

<p>At the same moment, Aunt Helen's door softly
shut, and Jean, her face full of glad expectancy, ran
lightly down the stairs. More than an hour later she
crept slowly up again, all the joy gone out of her
blanched face, her sensitive lips quivering piteously;
despair and misery in her eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>The following morning the <i>Vortex</i> sailed. Captain
Dodd and Dudley had called at the manor the
evening before, and in the merry little party speculations
were rife as to the cause of Farr's desertion, on
this his last evening in Hetherford. Jean forced herself
to sit quietly by and listen, and her heart grew
numb and cold. Outwardly, however, her manner
was so natural and self-possessed that Helen drew a
deep breath of relief, and persuaded herself that Jean
could not be so very unhappy.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>In the morning, at an early hour, Jean is on the
upper balcony. She crosses her arms on the rail, and
her eyes are fastened on the place where the <i>Vortex</i>
lies at anchor. Already her sails are set, and in
another moment the loud boom of her cannon announces
her departure. The girl shivers a little, but
does not stir from her position. Now the schooner is
sailing gallantly along, the sun shining full on her
white sails. Ah, how rapidly she nears the headland.
She is rounding it. Now, only the top of her
tall masts can be seen above the rocks. Ah, she is
gone. Jean's face drops on her crossed arms, and a
low cry breaks from her white lips.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the <i>Vortex</i> been an hour on her
way, when Miss Stuart presented herself in Helen's
room, and announced in tones of deepest regret that
she would be obliged to leave them on the following
day.</p>

<p>"Mother has issued her commands," she said dolefully,
and then, as a look of incredulity dawned in
Helen's face, she made haste to add, "and there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
many reasons why it is much better that I should
go."</p>

<p>Helen sighed, but did not attempt to alter her
friend's decision.</p>

<p>That evening, when the last farewell words had
been spoken to the friends from the inn and the
parsonage, Miss Stuart went up to her room followed
by the three Lawrence girls. Helen and Nathalie went
to work over her half-packed trunks, and Jean, leaning
against the footboard of the bed, looked on with
languid interest. Miss Stuart, who was complacently
issuing orders to the two packers, leaned lazily back
in an easy-chair, her white hands folded idly in her lap.
Jean surveyed her gravely, but without bitterness.
This was the woman whom Valentine Farr loved, and
much as she had suffered, she was ready to do her
full justice. Suddenly Miss Stuart looked up, and
their eyes met. Jean moved forward and held out
her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-night and good-by, Miss Stuart. I am very
tired and I fear I will not be up for the early train in
the morning. I hope you have been happy at the
manor." She broke off abruptly. She knew that she
ought to add, "I am sorry you are going," but the
words refused to pass her lips.</p>

<p>Miss Stuart rose and took the outstretched hand,
but she could not meet Jean's clear gaze.</p>

<p>It was late when the door closed upon Helen and
her kindly offices. Miss Stuart, possessed by an
intense restlessness, paced up and down the room.
Her thoughts were as accusing angels. What return
had she made for the kindness and hospitality of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
friends under whose roof she had spent the last three
weeks? Her wicked pride and passion had indeed
sown the seeds of misery in one heart. Of Jean she
had thought with shrinking, but trusting, faithful
Helen caused her the keener pang, the sharper suffering.
It was not too late, however. With one word
she could undo the mischief she had so deliberately
wrought. Just for one moment Miss Stuart's better
self held sway, softening her hard and jealous nature.
Just for one moment&mdash;then the impulse died out, and
with a reckless laugh she drowned the voice of
conscience.

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XVIII.<br /><br />
A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS.</h2>

<p class="p2">September with its bright, warm days and cool
nights was at hand. The gayeties of the summer
were a thing of the past, and the little colony of girls
had settled down into the old routine of life, "exactly
as we used to before the <i>Vortex</i> came," Mollie Andrews
said complacently. No voice was raised in contradiction,
and yet, perhaps no heart quite echoed the
sentiment.</p>

<p>Jean faced her trouble bravely and without complaint,
but the effort told on her as the days
passed by, and she grew frail and slender, and an
expression of deep sadness lingered in her soft eyes;
but the change in her took place so slowly, so gradually,
that no one seemed to be aware of it. As the days
shortened, they would spend their evenings over the
wood fire in the manor drawing-room, reading aloud
from some favorite book of poetry or prose. Jean
invariably found a place on the divan in the corner,
and when someone rallied her on her lazy habit, she
only smiled faintly and nestled down among the
cushions. One cold, gusty evening, when the rain
beat against the windowpanes and the wind howled
dismally about the house, Eleanor took up a volume
of poems from the table and began to read a poem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
called "&OElig;none." Helen's eyes unconsciously sought
Jean's face. It was half turned away, and one little
hand made shift to shield it, but Helen distinctly saw
two great tears steal silently down from under the
closed lids.</p>

<p>This set her heart to aching, and alone in her room
that night she pondered long what could be done for
her poor little sister. In the end she penned a letter,
which in the morning she carried herself to the post-office,
and anxiously awaited the result.</p>

<p>Before October had well-nigh come around, Jean
was really ill; so ill that Aunt Helen, and even
thoughtless Nathalie, were seriously concerned. All
day long she would lie on the sofa in her room,
scarcely speaking save in response to some direct
question that was put to her, and all through the
long hours of the night her tired eyes never closed.</p>

<p>"I don't think she ever sleeps," Nathalie confided
to Helen one day in a troubled voice. "Whenever I
speak to her she is always wide-awake, and once or
twice I have thought I heard her crying."</p>

<p>Helen shook her head sadly, and watched the mails
with an increasing impatience for the answer to her
letter. It came at last, and when she had read it
through hurriedly, she went at once to Jean's room,
and sitting down beside her, took her cold little hands
in hers.</p>

<p>"Do you feel so badly to-day, dear?" she said tenderly.</p>

<p>"No, Helen, only very tired."</p>

<p>The sigh with which these words were spoken went
right to Helen's heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you like to go away where you would have
a complete change of scene?"</p>

<p>Jean raised herself on her elbow, and turned an
eager eye toward her sister.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I want to go away. It's the only thing
in the world I really want, and oh, I want it so very
much. Helen, I&mdash;I can't stay here." Her voice
dropped to a whisper. "Don't you see how hard it
is for me?"</p>

<p>Helen bent down and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Well, darling, I have arranged it for you, and I
have only been waiting for this letter to tell you that
it was all right. You see, I didn't want to speak to
you, dear, until everything was settled. Now, shall I
read you what the letter says?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Helen drew the letter from her pocket and unfolded
it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I am so sorry to hear that poor little Jean is not well. It is hard
to imagine her otherwise than rosy and smiling. I think with you
that probably a change of scene would do her more good than all
the medicines in the world, and I see my way clear at once to carry
out your proposition. My aunt, Mrs. Fay, crosses in the middle
of October to join us here in Paris, and I want you to send Jean
over with her. The ocean trip will be the first step toward recovery,
and you must trust to our watchful care and the newness
of her surroundings to complete the cure."</p>
</div>

<p>Helen paused and Jean broke in hurriedly, a faint
color rising in her pale cheeks:</p>

<p>"Dear old Guy! how like him, always thoughtful,
always tender. O Helen, yes; let me go. I would
be so glad to, and I know it would do me good."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you be happy with Guy and his mother,
Jean?"</p>

<p>Jean's sad eyes met her sister's for a moment, and
then were slowly averted.</p>

<p>"I love them both dearly," she answered gently,
"and I want above everything to go away from
Hetherford. Please help me to do this, Helen. You
will gain Auntie's consent."</p>

<p>And with this reply Helen was fain to be content.
She had refrained from reading aloud the closing
lines of Guy's letter, which, running thus, had made
her heart beat strangely:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Our plans are somewhat indefinite. My aunt does not care
to spend more than two months over here, and it is her intention
to return home at Christmas time. If a stay of this duration
should effect Jean's cure she might return with her, for there is a
chance that she may be homesick so far away from you all. It
would be very pleasant to return home at this sweet season. My
own thoughts turn that way so often. Helen, can you never hold
out any hope to me? Must this season of peace come and go,
leaving my heart as lonely as ever? Must I wait forever, in
strange lands, for one word from you? Forgive me if I do
wrong to write you thus, but your letter has undone me.</p>

<p class="left45">
Faithfully yours,<br />
<span class="smcap i7">Guy Appleton.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In less than two weeks Jean Lawrence sailed for
Europe under the care of Mrs. Fay. A sense of
desolation inwrapped the manor. The weather was
sharp and cold and the sweet warm summer seemed a
dream, and every little thing that recalled it gave the
girls a pang. Emily Varian had departed, and both
the Hills and Andrews were about to turn their faces
cityward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>One crisp morning, when the wind blew fresh from
the northwest, Eleanor came out from the inn with
Cliff Archer at her side and started briskly forth in
the direction of the parsonage. Eleanor's face wore
an expression of deep dejection, and Cliff, observing
this, made comment on it:</p>

<p>"You are down on your luck."</p>

<p>Eleanor smiled somewhat dubiously:</p>

<p>"It is in the air, Cliff. I don't know what is the
matter with us all. Our good spirits seem to have
deserted us with Jean."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, broken by Archer. He
spoke slowly, as if not quite sure of his ground:</p>

<p>"It was in the air before Jean went away, I think.
It strikes me that she was fully under its influence
herself."</p>

<p>Eleanor shot a glance at her companion:</p>

<p>"Jean was not well, you know."</p>

<p>"And there was a cause. Come, Eleanor, let us be
frank. You may trust my affection for Jean to keep
me from prying into her affairs, but some things this
summer were quite too patent to be disregarded."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," Eleanor interposed
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do. It is natural for you to shield
Jean, because from your point of view, she has been
badly treated. Well, I don't agree with you in that.
If ever a man was honestly in love, that man was
Valentine Farr. I don't pretend to know what the
trouble was between them, but I have a suspicion, on
general principles, that jealousy was at the bottom of
it. I don't believe that Jean's was well founded and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
I wish she had a friend who felt at liberty to tell her
so. I have kept silent for a long time, too long perhaps;
but now I have set the ball rolling, and shall
await results."</p>

<p>They were in the parsonage grounds now, and
Eleanor paused and laid her hand lightly on Cliff's
arm.</p>

<p>"I would do anything in the world for Jean, as you
know, Cliff, but I feel too much in the dark to take
any step at present. You may be right; indeed, I
think you are; but remember neither you nor I are
quite sure of Jean's feeling on the subject, and it is a
very delicate matter to meddle with."</p>

<p>"I would risk it," smiled Cliff.</p>

<p>After a moment he spoke again, in a tone of deeper
earnestness:</p>

<p>"A very grave trouble can arise from a slight misunderstanding,
Eleanor. I wish, dear, that you and I
could put that possibility out of reach. I have tried
to be patient, but when I see so much sorrow brought
about undoubtedly by a lack of frankness and
confidence, I tremble for our future. If you do
care for me, dear, why will you not tell me so?
Surely you cannot doubt the sincerity of my love for
you."</p>

<p>Eleanor raised her eyes to her lover's face.</p>

<p>"I think you know, Cliff&mdash;&mdash;" she began, when
Nan's voice broke in upon them.</p>

<p>"Hello! Now what are you two doing, philandering
in this secluded spot?"</p>

<p>"Talking of subjects quite beyond your ken, my
dear," drawled Cliff lazily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>"You won't catch your train if you don't come
down to mother earth," laughed Nan.</p>

<p>Archer consulted his watch, and then bade the girls
a hurried good-by and started off for the station.
Nan linked her arm in Eleanor's and they proceeded
leisurely to the parsonage, talking as they went. One
sentence remained in Nan's mind, awakening there a
long train of thought.</p>

<p>"The summer is over, Nan, and we are about to
disband. We have, perhaps, had more gayety and less
real happiness than in the years gone by. I think
you know as well as I the reasons for this. You
are the only one, I think, who could set some
crooked matters straight. Suppose you see what
you can do?"</p>

<p>Enigmatical as the words were, Nan understood
their purpose, and when, on the last evening before
the Andrews and the Hills were to leave Hetherford,
they assembled at the manor, she had quite determined
to follow Eleanor's suggestion. It was a custom
of long standing for Nan, Mollie, and Eleanor to
spend the last night of the season with the Lawrence
girls, to talk over the events of the summer and to
anticipate the future.</p>

<p>To-night, as they gathered around the wide fireplace
in the drawing-room, a certain sadness hovered
over them, subduing their voices, breaking the conversation
with frequent spaces of silence. Their
hearts were full of thoughts that were left unspoken.
Jean's absence made itself strongly felt among them,
so closely was she associated with every like occasion
in the past.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing seems real without her," said Eleanor
drearily. "This parting is like no other."</p>

<p>"I hate partings anyway," cried Mollie. "I am
always so afraid that we will not come together again
quite in the old way!"</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"All things must change</p>
<p>To something new, to something strange!"</p>
</div>

<p>quoted Helen.</p>

<p>"Now, girls, this is nonsense," exclaimed Nathalie,
struggling with the lump that would rise in her throat.
"Jean is going to have a splendid time, and will come
home as strong and well as ever, and at Christmas
time you will all come up here and we will have a
grand reunion."</p>

<p>No answer to Nathalie's cheerful prediction suggested
itself, and Helen made a welcome diversion
by announcing that it was bedtime.</p>

<p>"Nan, will you share my room?" she asked as they
were on their way upstairs.</p>

<p>"Well, I should think so. I particularly want to
have a good talk with you alone."</p>

<p>"That is nice. I am just in the humor for it,
too."</p>

<p>When they had donned their wrappers Helen threw
herself down on the sofa before the open fire, and
Nan knelt down on the hearthstone to stir the logs
into a brighter blaze.</p>

<p>"A cheerful fire is always inspiring to me," she
said explanatorily. "I can talk so much better when
I am thoroughly warm and cozy."</p>

<p>Helen smiled indulgently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Nan; make yourself comfie, and then
talk to me."</p>

<p>The flames were crackling up the chimney now,
and Nan settled herself on the hearthrug with a sigh
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Do you think Jean will be happy so far away from
you all?"</p>

<p>"She wanted very much to go," Helen replied
evasively.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. Helen, Jean was not happy
before she went away. Did you not see it?"</p>

<p>Helen did not speak, and after a moment Nan
resumed quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes, Jean was unhappy, and yet Mr. Farr loved
her dearly."</p>

<p>Helen sat up and looked at her friend in blank
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, Nan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear, I couldn't help guessing it. Indeed, I
don't mean to be impertinent, but I believe Mr. Farr
was in love with Jean, and I can't bear to see everything
going wrong, when a little common sense would
set it right."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it would take more than that, Nan.
Mr. Farr is in love with Lillian, I think, and probably
he meant nothing by his attentions to Jean."</p>

<p>"He may have been in love with Miss Stuart once,
but he is not now," declared Nan in a tone of conviction.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Nan. I am sure you are."</p>

<p>"I think not," returned Nan stubbornly. "I have
had my eyes wide open, and I believe I am right."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why did he treat Jean so?" demanded
Helen. "Toward the end of his stay here he hardly
ever came to the manor, and he went away without
even calling to say good-by. In fact I don't think
Jean knew the <i>Vortex</i> was going."</p>

<p>But Nan's opinion was quite unshaken. She
dropped her chin in her hand and stared thoughtfully
into the fire.</p>

<p>"I will tell you something," she said impressively.
"The afternoon before the <i>Vortex</i> left, I was on
my way to the inn, when from a distance I saw Mr.
Farr turn in at the manor gates. You remember
that shortly after Bridget came over for me, and I
was so cross at having to leave our game of tennis?"</p>

<p>Helen nodded, and Nan went on:</p>

<p>"Well, on my way over I saw Mr. Farr come out
from the manor grounds. His cap was drawn down
over his eyes, and so lost was he in his own thoughts
that he passed me on the other side of the road, and
did not even see me. There was something in his
whole figure and bearing expressive of disappointment
and unhappiness. Oh, you needn't look incredulous,"
turning her head to scan Helen's face. "A person's
carriage is often most expressive."</p>

<p>"I wasn't looking incredulous, Nan, I was only
wondering what point you were going to make out of
all this."</p>

<p>"That Mr. Farr did go to the manor to say good-by
to Jean. I don't think he could have seen her,
for from the time he went in the manor gates until
he left them again, he could only have walked
to the door and right back again without stopping."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>"I know he didn't," said Helen quietly, "for Jean
told me so." She hesitated a moment, then added:
"Lillian was at home that afternoon."</p>

<p>Nan's face grew downcast.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he went to see Miss Stuart," she
persisted, somewhat unreasonably. "I believe that
there was some great mistake somewhere. I knew,"
she went on, as Helen did not reply, "that Jean was
surprised to find that he and Miss Stuart were old
friends. He may not have told her, but that was
probably accidental. At any rate that was the beginning
of the difficulty, and every incident from there on
served to widen the breach. Jean thought she had
been willfully deceived, and Miss Stuart was not loath
to lend herself to strengthen that conviction."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can blame Lillian," objected
Helen irritably. "It was not her fault that Mr. Farr
was in love with her. I think they were once engaged;"
this last somewhat fearfully, for she did not know that
she was doing right to betray her friend's secret.</p>

<p>Nan shrugged her shoulders:</p>

<p>"That may be, but it is only a greater reason why
he is not in love with her now."</p>

<p>This bit of worldly cynicism struck on deaf ears,
for Helen was revolving many things in her mind.</p>

<p>"There are, of course, many things that I cannot attempt
to explain," Nan continued, "but I still hold to my
belief that Mr. Farr cared for Jean. I like him, and
I don't believe he would ever have deliberately deceived
her."</p>

<p>A brief pause ensued.</p>

<p>"Nan," said Helen, "I wish the <i>Vortex</i> had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
never come to anchor here. Everything has gone
wrong since then."</p>

<p>"Be fair, Helen. Are you sure the fault lay
there? It seems to me that everything went happily
until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until when? Go on, Nan."</p>

<p>"Until Miss Stuart came."</p>

<p>Helen, who had been half-sitting up, with her head
propped on her hand, dropped back among the cushions
with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you should think so. You
are prejudiced against Lillian, and harsh in your
thoughts of her. I am not at all sure that it is fair."</p>

<p>Nan gained her feet, and looked gravely down at
her friend:</p>

<p>"Is it not true, dear? Think, Helen. Have not
many things gone wrong since your acquaintance with
Miss Stuart? Oh! I am sure of it, quite sure."</p>

<p>Unbroken silence.</p>

<p>"Are you angry with me, Helen?" Nan asked at
length.</p>

<p>"No, no."</p>

<p>"May I say something still further, dear?"</p>

<p>"Of course; I know you would never willfully be
unkind."</p>

<p>Nan sat down on the sofa:</p>

<p>"Things have gone wrong since the day you met
Miss Stuart, and the reason is that you persisted in
a friendship of which Guy so strongly disapproved.
Tell me, Helen, was it not Miss Stuart who separated
you from Guy? Was it not on her account that you
quarreled?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose so; but Guy was very strange and unreasonable,
and I liked Lillian; her friendship was
very sweet."</p>

<p>"O Helen, you had known Guy all your life;
you should have relied on his judgment, you should
have trusted him. Do you think that for any light or
insufficient reason he would have thwarted you? Had
he not always shown himself thoroughly unselfish in
everything that concerned you? You did him a very
cruel wrong when you mistrusted him, Helen; and I
don't see how you could have been so cold when he
loved you so."</p>

<p>For answer, Helen raised her eyes and looked at
Nan through her tears.</p>

<p>"I want to help you to see what a mistake you
have made," Nan continued gently. "You had grown
used to Guy, his devotion was such an old story that
you thought you did not love him. Miss Stuart's
great beauty fascinated you, and she soon found it
easy to bend you to her will. Forgive me, darling,
but this once I must speak bluntly. Many and many
a time you would have gone back to your allegiance
to Guy had she not willed it otherwise, and had he,
poor fellow, not taken the worst course for his cause.
It was foolish for him to go away, but Guy never
could bear half-measures. Since then you have
almost learned to know Lillian Stuart for yourself.
Yet, even to this day, you blind yourself about her. I
sometimes am tempted to think it is simply because
she is so beautiful."</p>

<p>Helen started up, her face ablaze.</p>

<p>"Nan, Nan, you are unjust. You despise me because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
I gave Guy up, but I tell you I realized I did
not love him before I ever saw Lillian Stuart. I do
love her."</p>

<p>"Pshaw," interrupted Nan indignantly. "Guy
Appleton is the best and truest man in the world, and
you must have loved him if you had not been unduly
influenced. There, dear, don't be angry. You know
how fond I am of Guy, and how keenly I took his
disappointment to heart. He loved you so, Helen,
and he was so miserable."</p>

<p>"Please spare me, Nan," murmured Helen
brokenly.</p>

<p>"I can't spare you, dear. If your mistakes had
simply made you suffer, I would never have said a
word, but it is not so. Miss Stuart has crossed
Jean's path, and for her sake I have spoken."</p>

<p>"If it is true, if I were sure of it, I would want to
die."</p>

<p>"Dying would not do any good. Live, and some
day it may be in your power to put an end to all this
sorrow."</p>

<p>"Nan, are you sure that Mr. Farr is in love with
Jean?"</p>

<p>"Not sure, Helen, but I think so."</p>

<p>"What can I do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at present. We must wait, and see
what happens. Oh! I am very hopeful for the
future."</p>

<p>When they were in bed and the lights were out,
Nan ventured to ask:</p>

<p>"Don't you think Guy will ever return to Hetherford?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, dear," Helen replied, with a sound
of tears in her voice.</p>

<p>Nan longed to shake her, to say "You ought to
know; it depends solely upon you; why don't you do
something about it?" but she felt she had gone far
enough for one night, and turning over on her pillow,
fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Nan was only a country-bred lass, and yet not all
her separation from the world and from her fellow-creatures
could shut her out from an unerring comprehension
of human nature. Her wide sympathies
taught her to understand Helen's coldness toward a
lover whose one fault was that he had demanded too
little and yielded too much; and she was too thorough
an artist not to fully appreciate the wonderful
spell that beauty such as Miss Stuart's casts upon
certain natures.</p>

<p>The next day the rain came down in sheets, and
nothing drearier could be imagined than the Hetherford
station, where Helen and Nathalie awaited the
arrival of their friends, who were to depart on the
train which was now almost due. Presently the old
omnibus backed up to the platform, and from its
damp interior the Hills and Andrews slowly emerged,
their faces as gloomy as the leaden sky above, as
they went through the irksome task of buying tickets
and checking trunks. Nan came rushing in upon
the scene just as the train drew up at the station.
There were a few hurried words of farewell, and then,
with a clanging of bells and puffing of steam, the
train sped on its way to the far-off city. When the
three girls clambered into the Lawrences' great closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
rockaway, they felt sorely tempted to give way to
tears and lamentations. The horses splashed through
the mud, the rain beat against the windowpanes, the
east wind wailed and sighed through the trees. Nan
got out at the parsonage, and in silence the two
sisters drove on to the manor. Nathalie threw off her
hat and coat, and seating herself at the big table in
the center of the hall-way, began a long letter to
Jean. From the fireside Helen watched her for a
few moments and then mounted slowly to her room,
feeling too dispirited for even Aunt Helen's society.</p>

<p>By and by a soft little voice from without begged
for admission, and she opened the door and gladly
drew Gladys into the room.</p>

<p>"Baby, you are just the little girlie I wanted.
Sister feels very dull and lonely to-day."</p>

<p>"Me too," echoed Gladys, as she climbed into her
lap.</p>

<p>"Well, well, that is too bad. We shall have to comfort
each other."</p>

<p>"What is comfort, sister?"</p>

<p>"Comfort, Dolly? Why to comfort anyone is to
try to make them happy when something is troubling
them."</p>

<p>"Auntie says I'se her comfort," Gladys affirmed,
with a wise little nod of her head.</p>

<p>"So you are, pet, and not only Auntie's, but mine
too."</p>

<p>The child nestled down contentedly in her sister's
arms. Her big eyes, wandering about the room,
rested at length upon a large folding frame of
photographs which stood on the mantel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish Jeanie didn't go 'way," she said in a
pathetic little voice.</p>

<p>"What made you think of Jean, dear?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I just was lookin' at her picture."</p>

<p>Helen lifted her eyes to the mantel.</p>

<p>"So you were. We all miss Jean very much, don't
we, darling?"</p>

<p>"Who's that, sister?" asked Gladys, pointing to
the photograph next to the one of Jean.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"I kind of 'member, but I ain't sure."</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten Mr. Appleton, Gladys&mdash;Guy
Appleton?" queried Helen in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, now I 'member," cried Gladys gleefully.
"Don't you know the little kitty he gave me? Larry
harnessed her to my little wed cart, an' she wan up
the willow tree with it." And at the recollection,
the child burst into a merry peal of laughter.</p>

<p>Helen laughed, too, in sympathy, and then it came
back to her how nicely Guy had spoken to the children,
telling them that what was fun to them was
suffering to poor kitty, and impressing upon them
how unkind and cowardly it was to be cruel to any
living creature.</p>

<p>They talked on thus, this big and little sister, until
twilight had come. Then Helen put the child down
from her lap, and sent her off to the nursery for her
supper. As she turned back into the room, her eyes
could just discern the outline of the frame upon the
mantel, but although the photographs within it were
quite obscured by the dusk, Guy's face rose before her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
with startling distinctness. She dropped into a chair,
and a dismal little laugh broke from her.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I wish Gladys and Nan had both kept
still. Now I don't know what I do want."</p>

<p>Week followed week monotonously, with little to
mark the flight of time save the arrival of letters from
Jean and the Appletons. Jean wrote cheerfully,
declaring that she was much better and in excellent
spirits, but Mrs. Appleton's reports were much less
encouraging.</p>

<p>"Jean never complains," she wrote, "and seems
filled with a restless desire to keep constantly on the
move, but she still looks very fragile, and I sometimes
fear that all at once she will break down completely.
However, you must not be anxious, about her, for perhaps
I am needlessly so. Mrs. Fay expects to return
home at Christmas time, and I imagine that by then
Jean will be quite ready to accompany her."</p>

<p>The last week in November Helen went to town to
spend Thanksgiving with the Hills.</p>

<p>"It seemed almost selfish to take you away from
Nathalie," Eleanor said, as they drove rapidly away
from the station through the noisy, crowded streets,
"but I was longing for a sight of someone from
Hetherford, and I thought it would be such fun to
begin to do our Christmas shopping together. A
little later the shops are so terribly overcrowded."</p>

<p>The first few days of Helen's visit were passed
chiefly in this wise, and partly because her time was
so fully occupied, and partly because of a curiously
uncomfortable feeling which she could not shake off,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
she neglected to let Miss Stuart know that she was in
town. On the fourth evening after her arrival they
dined at a famous restaurant with an uncle and aunt
of Eleanor's and two youths of the <i>jeunesse dorée</i>.
Helen had felt very shy at first, but this was fast
wearing off, and she was talking quite naturally and
pleasantly with her companion, when a party of two
ladies and half a dozen men entered the room, and
selecting a table at a short distance from where
Eleanor and her friends were seated, grouped themselves
about it; their loud talking and easy assurance
attracting universal attention. Helen stared at
them a little curiously, and then, as one of the ladies
drew off her long tan gloves and let her gaze wander
slowly around the room, she gave a sudden start. At
the same instant the lady's glance met Helen's, and
the recognition was mutual. Miss Stuart gracefully
inclined her head, a certain surprise in her eyes, and
Helen flushed crimson as she returned the bow.</p>

<p>"Why, there is Miss Stuart," exclaimed Eleanor.
"I can't imagine why she chooses such a companion
as Mrs. Desborough."</p>

<p>"And why should Miss Stuart be so particular?"
laughed the man at her side. "It would be the pot
calling the kettle black, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>Eleanor broke in hurriedly, with some totally irrelevant
remark, but the words had reached Helen's ears.
The color died out of her face, and from that moment
her companion found her silent and absent-minded.
As they passed out of the restaurant, Miss Stuart
bowed smilingly to Eleanor and turned a steady level
glance on Helen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>"Who were you bowing to?" asked Mrs. Desborough
from the other side of the table.</p>

<p>"To Miss Hill and her friend Miss Lawrence,"
Miss Stuart replied a little stiffly.</p>

<p>"What?" laughed the man at her side, "not that
demure little girl who was dining with Miss Hill?"</p>

<p>"The very same. She is a great friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, don't tell me that. You two never
hit it off together."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart frowned.</p>

<p>"You will oblige me by not discussing the subject,"
she returned, in a tone so unlike her usual careless,
flippant one that her companion was impressed
by it. "I like her infinitely better than any woman I
have ever known."</p>

<p>"By Jove, I believe you are in earnest!"</p>

<p>"Don't believe anything," she answered sharply,
and turning to the man on her left plunged at once
into a reckless flirtation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XIX.<br /><br />
A CABLEGRAM.</h2>

<p class="p2">The following morning a note came for Helen by
a messenger. It was from Lillian Stuart and,
without a word of upbraiding for having been kept in
ignorance of Helen's presence in town, begged for
a visit from her prior to her return to Hetherford.
Helen was fully alive to the generous spirit thus shown
toward her, but it did not alter her determination to
decline the invitation. She worded her answer as
kindly as possible, while making her meaning quite
clear. It hurt her cruelly to take this step, and as she
sealed the envelope there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Hill's day at home, and when, after
luncheon, Eleanor reminded Helen of this fact, the
girl pleaded to be excused, for she felt far too depressed
and out of sorts to meet people and to exert
herself to entertain them. Mrs. Hill indulgently
granted her request, and so she put on her hat and
coat and started out for a walk. She strolled down
a beautiful avenue, lined with fine residences, succeeded,
as she proceeded, by richly and gayly ornamented
shops. A crowd of people were passing up
and down, and the street at times was almost blocked
with an innumerable throng of equipages. When
Helen had reached a point where this avenue is intersected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
by another, she crossed the street and entered
a square, whose patches of grass and bare trees were
a rest to her eyes after the rows of stately buildings
all about her. Children were playing about on the
smooth paths, and as Helen looked at them she found
herself longing for a sight of dear little Gladys' round,
chubby face. Across the street, on the block below,
a swinging sign caught her attention. Its staring
characters told her that an art exhibition was being
held within, and she turned her steps in that direction.
As she approached the showy and over-ornamented
doorway, she glanced up at a man who was coming
toward her. Something in his gait and general bearing
struck her as familiar. As he gained her side he
raised his hat, and she saw that he was Valentine
Farr.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Lawrence," he exclaimed, "this is a
very great and unexpected pleasure. I had no idea
you were in town. How are you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! very well, thank you, but," with a sympathetic
glance at his arm, which she saw he carried in a sling,
"have you been hurt, Mr. Farr?"</p>

<p>"I had a fall aboard ship on our way to Fort
Munroe, and broke my arm. It was badly attended
to, so I got leave to come home and have Dr. &mdash;&mdash;,"
naming a well-known surgeon, "fix it up for
me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Helen, looking at him with
friendly eyes.</p>

<p>"Where were you going, Miss Lawrence?" Farr
asked, as the surging throng crowded them close to
the railing of a near house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought I would go in just above here, and see
the pictures."</p>

<p>"Will you let me accompany you? I would deem
it a very great favor, I have so many questions I want
to ask you. I want to know all about Hetherford
and everyone there.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I wish you would, and I will gladly satisfy
your curiosity. There is not much to tell of Hetherford
save that Jean has gone to Europe."</p>

<p>She tried to mention her sister's name quite
naturally, but the color rose to her face, and she could
not bring herself to look at her companion.</p>

<p>"To Europe?" he echoed, and could think of
nothing further to say.</p>

<p>"I will tell you all about it when we are inside,"
Helen said to him rather flurriedly.</p>

<p>In a moment more they found themselves in a
softly lighted room, the walls of which were lined
with paintings. A few people, catalogue in hand,
were slowly walking about or standing in groups of
two or three before some painting of more than usual
merit. Helen gained courage to raise her eyes to her
companion's face, and something in its expression
made her direct her steps at once toward a huge
red ottoman which occupied the center of the
room.</p>

<p>"Shall we sit down here and have our talk first?"
her voice softly interrogated. "You can show me
the pictures afterward."</p>

<p>Farr looked at her gratefully.</p>

<p>"It would be my wish, Miss Helen, but you mustn't
let me bore you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>For answer, Helen seated herself and motioned him
to take the place beside her.</p>

<p>"Jean went to Europe in October. She had not
been at all well, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not well?" he interrupted her with an anxious
face.</p>

<p>"In fact, she was quite ill," Helen went on gravely,
"and she had an opportunity to join some friends of
ours who were over there, so we sent her in the hope
that the change would benefit her."</p>

<p>"And how is she now?"</p>

<p>"Somewhat better, I think, but not very strong
yet."</p>

<p>"I am deeply grieved," he answered, in a voice
which his best efforts could not keep very steady.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, during which Farr's eyes
were fixed moodily on the carpet.</p>

<p>"I called to see your sister," he began at length,
"the day before we left Hetherford, but she excused
herself."</p>

<p>"I don't think Jean knew of your visit."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," he returned bitterly. "The
servant who admitted me had received orders that
Miss Jean would not see me, and she made that fact
patent to me beyond the possibility of any doubt."</p>

<p>"I cannot help that," said Helen, her determination
to pursue the subject struggling against a sudden
timidity. "I am sure you are wrong. I remember
the afternoon perfectly. Nathalie and I had been to
the inn, and when we reached home I found Jean on
the sofa in her room, and I asked her if anyone had
called, and she said 'no.'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>A puzzled expression crossed Farr's face.</p>

<p>"It is very strange. Why, Miss Helen, I wrote and
asked your sister if she would see me, and she replied
that she would be at home at the hour I mentioned
in my note."</p>

<p>All at once there flashed through Helen's mind a
recollection which suggested a most cruel suspicion.
Farr was looking straight at her, his honest eyes demanding
an honest answer.</p>

<p>"I cannot explain it, Mr. Farr," she said slowly,
"but I feel perfectly safe in answering you that it
was all a mistake, and that Jean never knew of your
call at the manor."</p>

<p>"And what of the message the servant gave me?
Forgive me, Miss Helen, if I seem to press you, but
this is no light matter to me."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure that Jean never gave that message,
although I can give you no further explanation
of the matter."</p>

<p>Farr's face went very white, and, as Helen looked
at him, she saw how much the past few months had
changed him. There were deep lines about his mouth,
and his grave eyes were immeasurably sad. Her
heart went out to him in sudden sympathy, and she
spoke to him with a touch of tenderness in her voice.</p>

<p>"Jean will be with us again at Christmas time, I
hope, and then you must see her and let her explain
to you how such a mistake was made."</p>

<p>Farr rested his elbow on his knee and dropped his
head in his hand.</p>

<p>"If I only felt sure you were right, Miss Helen."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
He paused a moment, then resumed with deep earnestness,
"I cared so much for your sister that the
sudden withdrawal of her friendship was a bitter blow
to me."</p>

<p>Helen's eyes were downcast, her lips refused to
speak. The silence was broken by Farr.</p>

<p>"I think at one time I dreamed she cared for me a
little, but my illusion was quickly dispelled."</p>

<p>Another pause of briefer duration, and then he
turned to his companion with a question on his
lips.</p>

<p>"How was it, Miss Helen? Did I presume too
much on your sister's kindness to me? I suppose
I must have, although it seems to me that I hardly
deserved her excessive coldness and dislike."</p>

<p>Helen, thus put to the test, looked straight up at
him, and answered a little tremulously:</p>

<p>"Mr. Farr, Jean always liked you."</p>

<p>He drew a quick sharp breath.</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" he asked. Then before
Helen could reply, he went on in a strained voice,
"I loved Jean with all my heart, and was about to ask
her to be my wife. I love her now&mdash;I shall always
love her."</p>

<p>"And Jean cares for you," Helen whispered, so
low he had to bend his head to catch the words.</p>

<p>"Cares for me?" he repeated, a sudden light in his
eyes, his voice grown very deep and tender.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh yes. There must have been some
wretched mistake which can be explained away. I
don't know how it was," she went on with a plaintive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
smile. "Jean's heart was almost broken because of
you, and she grew so ill we had to send her away."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he ejaculated solemnly.</p>

<p>Helen broke into a little laugh, which was full of
tears.</p>

<p>"That Jean has gone away?" she queried.</p>

<p>Farr lifted his head and drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"I can't thank you, Miss Helen. I seem to have
no words to express to you what you have done for
me to-day. Indeed, it seems as if Fate, for once,
had chosen to do me a kind turn."</p>

<p>After a little Helen said gently:</p>

<p>"You must come to the manor for Christmas, Mr.
Farr. I can think of no greater happiness for Jean
than to have you there to welcome her on her return."</p>

<p>"Miss Helen, I&mdash;I can't realize it. You&mdash;&mdash;" His
voice broke, but after a moment he resumed: "You
are not holding out a vain hope to me&mdash;you are
sure?"</p>

<p>Helen met his eyes steadily, and he was reassured,
even before she answered gravely:</p>

<p>"Quite sure, Mr. Farr. Do you think I would
have spoken else?"</p>

<p>She turned away her head, and he saw a tear on
her cheek.</p>

<p>"I have tried to fill my mother's place to the girls,
but I was blinded by personal interests, and did not
understand about Jean until too late. I don't think I
could have borne it if it had not been put in my
power to retrieve my mistake."</p>

<p>Farr looked at her curiously, a thoroughly puzzled
expression on his face. He opened his lips to question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
her, but suddenly changed his mind, and closed
them without having spoken.</p>

<p>Helen rose from the ottoman.</p>

<p>"We have not seen the pictures, have we?" she
asked in a lighter tone.</p>

<p>Farr stood looking down at her with earnest eyes.</p>

<p>"Miss Helen, if God is good to me, if all goes well,
is there a welcome for me at the manor?"</p>

<p>She put out her hand to him, and he held it tightly
for a moment.</p>

<p>"God bless you."</p>

<p>Some minutes later they descended the wide stairs,
and, passing through the outer door, found themselves
once more in the crowded thoroughfare. The
short November day was drawing to a close, the wind
was keen and sharp, and a flurry of snow filled the
air.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Farr, I want you to put me in an omnibus,
please, and you must not come uptown with
me."</p>

<p>Then, as he demurred, she added, with a friendly
smile:</p>

<p>"My mind is so full of thoughts, I would really
rather be alone for a while. You understand, don't
you?"</p>

<p>She turned on the steps of the omnibus to say:</p>

<p>"I will let you know about Jean's return, and remember,
you are to spend Christmas with us."</p>

<p>"As if I could forget," Farr murmured to himself,
as he strode away, his face alight with a great happiness.</p>

<p>As Helen rang the bell of the Hills' cozy apartment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
the door was opened from the inside, and she
found herself face to face with Lillian Stuart. From
the drawing-room came the buzz of tongues, and
through the half-open portières she could see quite a
number of people standing about. Miss Stuart answered
her unspoken thought:</p>

<p>"Don't go in there, Helen; take me to your room.
I want to speak to you for a moment. I have already
made my call on the Hills."</p>

<p>Helen obediently led the way down the hall, but
her heart was very heavy, for she had no courage for
another scene this afternoon. She knew that the conversation
must necessarily be painful, and she made
every effort to put off the evil moment; but in vain.
Almost before the door was closed Miss Stuart
began:</p>

<p>"Now, Helen, will you please explain to me why
you must return to Hetherford in such haste? Surely
your aunt can spare you to me for a few days. I
can't imagine how you could have planned to be in
town, and not to be with me for a little visit."</p>

<p>Helen flushed guiltily.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, dear," she faltered. "Another
time, perhaps, but now I must go home."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart started up, loosening her fur boa impatiently.</p>

<p>"That is absolute folly. There is nothing to stand
in the way unless&mdash;&mdash;" She broke off abruptly, and
her eyes searched Helen's downcast face. "Do you
want to put an end to our friendship," she cried
sharply. "Is that why you act so strangely?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>Helen lifted her hand with an imploring gesture
of dissent.</p>

<p>"Answer me, Helen. Am I not right?"</p>

<p>Helen's head was bent still lower, and she made no
attempt to speak. Miss Stuart watched her for a moment
in silence, and a slight quiver passed over her
face. She came a step nearer, and laid her hand on
the girl's shoulder:</p>

<p>"Who has influenced you against me, Helen?
What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Why, Lillian, what makes you say that? It is not
fair, simply because in one instance I am unable to
fulfill your wishes."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart withdrew her hand, and her brow
darkened.</p>

<p>"Helen, Helen; you disappoint me. Let us have
the truth at all hazards. Tell me frankly, would not
your answer always be the same now, whenever I
might ask you for a visit?"</p>

<p>Helen shivered a little, and she could not bring
herself to meet the girl's eyes. Presently Miss Stuart
spoke again, the effort to subdue all emotion rendering
her voice cold and stern.</p>

<p>"I understand. You have withdrawn your friendship
from me. Oh! no doubt you have discovered
the depth of my unworthiness, and feel perfectly
justified. Content in your own moral superiority,
and in that of your friends in general, you have decided
that it would be wiser to banish me from the
inner circle. Of course," she went on with a bitter
laugh, "you have not reached this conclusion alone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Would you mind telling me who has helped you to
it?"</p>

<p>The taunting question stung Helen into a response:</p>

<p>"You told me an untruth, Lillian. You deliberately
deceived me. You caused untold suffering to
one who is very dear to me, to what end I cannot
imagine. And this was your return for all the love
and trust I had given you."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart turned a startled glance on Helen.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I have seen Mr. Farr to-day, and a good many
things that have puzzled me have been made clear.
I am not judging you, Lillian. I am completely in the
dark as to your motives. I only know that you were
not honest with me."</p>

<p>"So you have seen Val Farr," murmured Miss
Stuart. She flung back her head defiantly. "Well,
what did he tell you of me? I thought he was too
much of a man to speak ill of a woman."</p>

<p>"Your name was never mentioned, Lillian. I am
not prepared to tell you what Mr. Farr said to me.
Suffice it to say, it proved the untruth of what you led
me to believe last summer."</p>

<p>Miss Stuart caught her breath.</p>

<p>"I suppose that means that he is in love with your
sister?"</p>

<p>"We will not discuss that, please," replied Helen
with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>Her companion laughed, but there was no mirth in
the sound.</p>

<p>"Well, I could have told you that last summer. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
did lie to you about it. The game is played out
now, and I have lost, so there is no further reason
why I should not tell you the truth. I was jealous of
that little sister of yours, and I did everything in my
power to keep her and Valentine Farr apart. Placed
in the same position, I should undoubtedly repeat the
offense."</p>

<p>Cruel and unwomanly as the words were, there was
something in her friend's voice which stirred Helen
with a feeling of pity. She rose and laid a gentle
hand on Miss Stuart's arm.</p>

<p>"You must not try to make me think badly of you,
dear. I would so much rather believe that you did
not realize how much misery you were causing. Let
us not speak any more of this, Lillian."</p>

<p>A sudden rush of tears dimmed Miss Stuart's eyes.</p>

<p>"The least I can do is to grant your last request,
Helen. One thing more I can do for you, dear&mdash;I
can go. You need never see me again."</p>

<p>There was just a faint interrogation in the low-spoken
words, but Helen remained quite silent. She
was waging a bitter fight within herself. Everything
pressed her into a renunciation of this friendship
which had cost her so dear. Slowly there was awakening
within her a deep knowledge of Guy Appleton's
character, and with this knowledge came a great longing
to win from him the love which she had so lightly
sacrificed. While a vestige of this friendship remained
Guy would never take her to his heart, and now her
choice must be made. Then she thought of Jean and
Valentine Farr, and the thought strengthened her
conviction that only one path was open to her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Raising her tearstained face, she met Lillian's eyes
smiling sadly on her.</p>

<p>"So you find it hard to give me up, Helen? Are
you sure it is necessary?"</p>

<p>The critical moment had come, and involuntarily
Helen put her hands before her eyes to shut out the
beautiful face so close to her own:</p>

<p>"Our paths must lie apart, Lillian, dear; but as
long as I live I will remember you and pray for you."</p>

<p>The silence that followed these words became oppressive,
and Helen stirred uneasily and stole a timid
glance at her friend. Miss Stuart's face was uplifted;
her wonderful eyes, filled with unutterable sadness,
gazed mournfully into space. If suffering can expiate
a sin, in that moment she fully expiated the wrong
she had done to Jean. After a while she turned and
laid her hands on Helen's shoulders.</p>

<p>"I understand, my dear, and I do not blame you.
Good-by!" And stooping, she kissed her gently on
the lips.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Helen stood before the fire in the hall-way of the
manor, two letters in hand, a thoughtful expression
in her eyes. In four days Jean and Mrs. Fay would
sail for home, and Guy had written: "Will you not
send for me, Helen? I will never return until you
do."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," her thoughts ran, "why must it be
left for me to decide! If Guy would only take it into
his own hands and come, I would be so grateful."</p>

<p>Poor weak little woman! It was hard for her to
act for herself. How happy she would be to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
shelter in some safe harbor, guided there by a stronger
hand than her own. With one stroke of a pen she
could recall Guy, but the strangest shyness overmastered
her. She wandered restlessly about the
house, her heart as heavy as lead; and not until daylight
was waning, and the long winter evening closing
in upon the manor, did she finally start out for the
telegraph office, a bit of paper held closely in the
hand that was tucked in her muff.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>In a hotel in Paris a party of people was assembled
in a small private sitting-room. Against the walls,
their lids gaping, were a number of half-filled trunks,
and in the paraphernalia that were scattered around
was every indication of an imminent departure.
Mrs. Fay and Jean bustled busily about, stowing away
the many purchases which this city of shops had
tempted them to make, stopping now and then to consult
Guy as to some detail of the long journey which
lay before them. Poor Mrs. Appleton watched them
with homesick eyes. She was tired of wandering
about in strange lands, hungry for a sight of the little
vine-covered cottage which had been empty for so
many weary months. Surely no mother had ever
given her son a greater love, a more generous sacrifice.</p>

<p>"I am a foolish old woman, my dear," she had said
to him a few moments since, when he had looked up
suddenly and had seen the tears in her eyes. "I suppose
it is not unnatural that I should sometimes dream
of spending the last years of my life in 'my own
home.'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>Guy did not answer then. It was a shock to him
to discover how much this exile had cost his patient,
uncomplaining mother; and, as he sat at the little table
in the center of the room, apparently absorbed in
straightening out accounts, he was facing the duty
which had suddenly been made clear to him.</p>

<p>"Poor mother!" he thought, with tender compunction,
"I have been a selfish brute."</p>

<p>Yet it was not easy for him to depart from the
course he had marked out for himself, for, like many
another man of strong character, Guy was very obstinate.
One glance at his mother's face, however,
made him ashamed of his hesitation, and he pushed
away his papers and rose to his feet, while he framed
the sentence which would determine their return
home. Just at that moment there was a knock at the
door, and in response to Jean's brisk, "<i>Entrez</i>," a
servant handed her a cablegram in its blue wrapper,
addressed "Appleton, Continental, Paris."</p>

<p>Three simple words the message contained, but to
the man who read them they made all the difference
between light and darkness, between life and death.
The message read:</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XX.<br />
"PEACE ON EARTH&mdash;GOOD WILL TO MEN."</h2>

<p class="p2">On a most delicious day late in December there is
an air of unusual bustle and excitement over the
manor. Outside the ground is covered with a deep
mantle of glistening snow, and overhead the winter's
sun shines cold and clear from out a vault of deepest
blue. Within the house wood fires are blazing on
every hearth, and the atmosphere is filled with the
fragrance of fresh flowers which Helen's deft hands
have just arranged in every available vase and bowl.</p>

<p>Only yesterday the travelers from the other side
arrived; Mrs. Appleton supremely contented to be
once more at home; Guy, with the anticipation of
his happiness lighting his whole face, and Jean sweet
and brave as ever, but with a deep sadness in her eyes,
and looking such a frail and slender figure in her close-fitting
gown.</p>

<p>Helen and Nathalie had gone to town to meet them,
and had brought them to Hetherford; for on the
morrow all the old friends were to gather at the manor
for Christmas, and the girls wanted one long quiet
evening with Jean before the arrival of their guests.</p>

<p>This home-coming was very hard for poor Jean;
harder than she had anticipated; and when the first
little excitement of her meeting with Aunt Helen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
the children was over, it required all her courage to
keep her face bright and smiling, her voice gay and
cheery. Everything spoke to her of Farr, and she
sighed a little wearily, as she realized that all her
journeyings had lessened not one whit the pain at her
heart. As they gathered before the blazing logs in
the drawing-room, just after dinner, to talk over all
that had happened since they parted, Helen's loving
heart detected the undercurrent of pathos which ran
through all Jean's spirited accounts of her travels
and adventures; and she was tempted to speak just
the few words which alone could bring back the sunny
light-hearted expression to Jean's face. She resisted
the temptation, however, for she had given Farr her
promise that his coming on the morrow should be a
complete surprise. He was to come out on an early
train, so as to secure a quiet hour with Jean before
the manor was invaded by its other guests.</p>

<p>And now he is almost due, and Helen's heart beats
fast, and her eyes watch Jean's every movement as if
she feared to let her out of her sight. All the morning
they have been dressing the house with Christmas
greens, and Jean stands on tip-toe to fasten the last
wreath over the fireplace, when a ringing of sleigh-bells
breaks the stillness of the snowy winter's day.
Then there is a stamping of a man's feet on the
veranda, and Helen opens wide the door to admit
Valentine Farr. Jean's back is toward him, and
there is just a brief instant while she adjusts the last
nail to secure the wreath, before she turns.</p>

<p>"What a draught. Why don't you close the&mdash;&mdash;"
she begins; then, turning, the hammer she is holding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
falls to the ground with a crash, and, her hand on her
heart, her eyes wide-open and startled, she stands
facing Valentine Farr.</p>

<p>In another instant Helen has closed the door and
disappeared into the drawing-room, and Farr has
taken Jean's hands in his own, and is speaking to
her in a voice grown very deep and tender.</p>

<p>"Jean, my little love, have you no word of welcome
for me?"</p>

<p>The blood rushes into her face, then ebbs away,
leaving it even paler than before.</p>

<p>"Ah, I have frightened you, sweetheart," Farr
cries contritely, "and you are not very strong yet, are
you, dear? But I have waited such a weary while;
I have been so miserable for a sight of your sweet
face; I could not wait to tell you that I love you.
Surely you must have known it long ago, darling."</p>

<p>Jean's head droops lower and lower, and she does
not speak.</p>

<p>"I want you to be my wife, dear," Farr's tender
voice goes on. "Do you love me, Jean?"</p>

<p>Still she is silent, and Farr's face grows very white.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jean? Are you angry with me for
speaking to you so abruptly? Oh, my love, my love,
don't tell me that you cannot care for me."</p>

<p>Then Jean raises her eyes, and though the tears
are shining in them, they are full of a great happiness.</p>

<p>"I do love you, dear, with all my heart and soul,"
she says very low, but quite steadily.</p>

<p>Farr's face above her is eloquent, and for the moment
they have no need of words. Then the tears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
brim over in Jean's eyes, and with a little tremulous
cry she flings herself in his arms:</p>

<p>"O Val, I have been so miserable!"</p>

<p>And Farr, bending down, kisses her tenderly.</p>

<p>"Please God, darling, no misery will ever again
come to you through me."</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>A few hours later they all gather about the long
dinner table and, in the pause that follows upon their
being seated, old Mr. Birdsall's sweet and tremulous
voice asks grace. In simple heartfelt words he
thanks God for the safe return of the travelers, and
asks his tender blessing for one and all. Every head
is reverently bent, and every heart echoes the earnest
prayer.</p>

<p>This is a gala occasion, and in its honor Aunt Helen
presides at the head of the table, and Willie and Larry
and even little Gladys are present. With much ringing
laughter and merriment the dinner hour passes.
Jean's voice is as joyous as in the old days, and Helen,
hearing the sweet sound, is filled with overwhelming
gratitude.</p>

<p>"I tell you, girls," Dick cries enthusiastically,
"this is a proud day for me. I feel that it is entirely
owing to my watchful care of you all that these pleasant
things have come to pass. Jean, my child, did I
not present Farr to you?"</p>

<p>Jean laughs, and blushes.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, Dick. I am not quite clear
about it. If you did I am deeply indebted," and she
turns a shy soft glance toward her lover.</p>

<p>"It was your humble servant. Now, there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
most appropriate way in which you may reward me,"
and Dick holds a sprig of mistletoe high above his
head.</p>

<p>"No, no. What nonsense," protests Jean.</p>

<p>"You may," smiles Farr.</p>

<p>"But I don't want to," she laughs saucily.</p>

<p>"Poor Dick," exclaims Mollie sorrowfully, and she
jumps up from the table to give him a sisterly hug and
a kiss. "I declare it is a shame. I shan't see you
so neglected."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," returns Dick, with a grin,
"that isn't quite the same, but it is very sweet."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighs Nan, as they push back their
chairs, and wander into the drawing-room, "how
queer it seems to have Helen and Jean engaged. It
is all very amusing now, but what will become of us
next summer. I am afraid our compact is about at
an end."</p>

<p>Cliff, who is standing near Eleanor, bends down to
whisper something to her, and then pushes her gently
into the middle of the room. She faces the group before
her with flaming cheeks, and looks about her helplessly.</p>

<p>"Girls, I suppose I must confess. I, too, am a
traitor to our compact."</p>

<p>"O Eleanor," cries Jean, excitedly, and puts a
tender arm about her.</p>

<p>Cliff leans against the mantel, as nonchalant and
languid as ever; but his eyes rest on Eleanor with infinite
pride and content. The girl turns toward the
others with a graceful gesture of appeal.</p>

<p>"Am I forgiven?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>They crowd about her with eager, loving words
of congratulation; and then, when the confusion
has subsided, Nan begs their attention for a moment.</p>

<p>"I have some news for you."</p>

<p>"O Nan! don't tell us you are engaged," implores
Mollie dolorously.</p>

<p>Nan burst into a merry laugh.</p>

<p>"What an idea! No indeed. But, girls and boys
what do you think? Emily is <i>married</i>!"</p>

<p>"<i>Married?</i>" they cry in one breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, married to a very rich widower, with gray
hair, and three big children, and oh, lots of money!"
and Nan almost chokes in her haste to enumerate all
these virtues.</p>

<p>"Now, Nan, be sensible, and take a long breath,
and tell us all about it," says Nathalie.</p>

<p>"Well, he owns a fine place at B&mdash;&mdash;, where Em lives,
and he knew her when she was a little bit of a girl.
He married and went to England to live. About
two years ago his wife died and this fall he returned
to B&mdash;&mdash;, renewed his acquaintance with Em, proposed
to her, and yesterday they were married."</p>

<p>"What unseemly haste!" Mollie exclaims.</p>

<p>"No, not a bit of it. They didn't mean to be
married until spring, but Mr. Hazletine was suddenly
recalled to England on important business, which may
keep him there several months, and he was so unhappy
at leaving Em that she consented to be married at
once and go with him."</p>

<p>"To think of it! I suppose now Emily will roll by
in her carriage, wear magnificent clothes, and completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
dazzle us with her jewels of inestimable
value."</p>

<p>"So much the better, Mollie," rejoins Helen
heartily. "Poor little Em has tasted of poverty all
her life. Think what a relief it will be to her to have
ample means."</p>

<p>"It is fine," cries Eleanor.</p>

<p>"And what in the world shall we do?" groans
Nathalie with a comical glance at Nan and Mollie.</p>

<p>"Laugh at their love-making, and, with the hansom
driver, be glad we are not in it."</p>

<p>"O Nan, you rowdy," laughs Jean.</p>

<p>Helen rises, and makes her way to the door, closely
followed by Guy.</p>

<p>"I am going to say good-night to Aunt Helen,"
she whispers, her eyes drooping shyly under the
steadfast gaze he bends upon her.</p>

<p>"I will wait for you here, dear," he says, and takes
her hand in his, but she blushes so painfully he lets
it drop again.</p>

<p>"Foolish little woman," he sighs to himself.
"Shall I ever really possess her heart?"</p>

<p>In a few moments she rejoins him, and Guy puts his
arm about her, and leads her into the music room.
No lamps are lighted, but the window-shades are up,
and the moon's soft rays shine through the panes,
illumining mysteriously the great empty room. Far
away, across the snowclad landscape, the slender spire
of St. Andrew's points heavenward, and through the
windows of the church shines the red glow of a light
within. The scene is one of infinite peace and beauty,
and the magic of the hour casts its spell over Helen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
and her lover, as speechless, motionless, they stand
within the recess of the window, gazing out at the
marvelous beauty of the night.</p>

<p>By and by, Helen moves a little closer to her companion.</p>

<p>"I have something to tell you, Guy," she murmurs,
"and I haven't the courage to say it."</p>

<p>The old doubt, not yet dispelled, pales Guy's face.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you are going to send me from
you again, Helen."</p>

<p>The girl's heart throbs at the pain in his voice:</p>

<p>"No, no, dear. I want to tell you something so
different. I love you, Guy," her voice dropping to a
whisper. "Please never leave me again."</p>

<p>He holds her to his heart with a love the deeper
for all the pain and waiting, finding a heaven in the
sweet lips which meet his so frankly. And even as
they stand there the bell of St. Andrew's, solemnly
tolling the midnight hour, ushers in the glad Christmas
tide.</p>

<p>"Helen," says Eleanor's voice from the doorway,
"may we all come in? We think it would be so
sweet if you would play our Christmas hymn on the
organ and let us sing it together."</p>

<p>Helen pushes back the curtain, and steps forward,
an expression of perfect rest on her gentle face.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I think it is a lovely idea."</p>

<p>Guy opens the organ. Helen steps into her place,
and Cliff brings a lamp from the hall, and places it
nearby.</p>

<p>"Val," Jean whispers to her lover, "there is just one
sad thought in my heart to-night. I suppose it is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
memory of Christ's message of peace and love, which
makes me so sorrowful when I think of the bitter
feeling between your mother and yourself. Do you
think it will ever be in my power to help to overcome
it?"</p>

<p>"We will try together, sweetheart, and the great
blessing of your love will make all life easier, and
better for me."</p>

<p>Then Helen's hands strike the opening chords of
the hymn and a hush falls upon the little group, and
with one accord they move nearer the organ, and as
the last bell of St. Andrew's dies slowly away, their
voices take up the glad refrain:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>It came upon the midnight clear,</p>
<p>That glorious song of old,</p>
<p>From angels bending near the earth,</p>
<p>To touch their harps of gold:</p>
<p>"Peace on the earth, good will to men,</p>
<p>From heaven's all-gracious King."</p>
<p>The world in solemn stillness lay,</p>
<p>To hear the angels sing.</p>
